Coleridge Initiative Project - Kaggle Competition Using NLP

Coleridge Initiative

PURPOSE
The purpose of this project is to identify the mention of datasets in scientific publications, using publications available through multiple US Government Agencies. Natural Language Processing (NLP) and various other statistical techniques are used to cleanse and pre-process the data, eventually adding Machine Learning Models that will parse through the JSON and extract the datasets mentioned in the publications.

INITIALIZING THE PROJECT
The first steps taken in the project were reading in four different .json files and one .csv files. The .csv file is used to train the models, whereas the models are actually ran against the .json files. The pre-processing steps include things like removing punctuation, reducting to lowercase, and tokenizing the data.
