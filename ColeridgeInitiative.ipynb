(Batty et al., 2008) Deficits in general neurocognitive performance are pervasive in most psychiatric and neurologic disorders, yet are often the most difficult component to treat. (Millan et al., 2012) As such, understanding the neurobiology of human cognition is potentially critical to improving physical and mental health outcomes in society. (Deary et al., 2010) While both genetic background and environmental experience interact to shape cognitive development, twin and family studies have consistently demonstrated heritability of more than 50% for general cognitive ability measured in adulthood. ) Allelic variation can have a direct influence on brain biology by modifying the molecular structure and/or function of brain-expressed transcripts and proteins such as neurotransmitter receptors and neurodevelopmental growth factors. (Chen et al., 2004) However, attempts to pinpoint loci associated with human cognition across diverse population samples have proven challenging due to the difficulty of assembling the large cohorts required to detect small expected effects of individual variants in a highly polygenic trait. (Benyamin et al., 2014; Chabris et al., 2012; Luciano et al., 2011; Lencz et al., 2013; Need et al., 2009; Davies et al., 2011 Davies et al., , 2015 Martin et al., 2011) By contrast, educational history is easily obtainable demographic information collected in any field of medical research, and can therefore be collected in more readily across large cohorts as compared to cognition. Educational attainment, as measured by self-reported years of schooling, has been proposed as a 'proxy phenotype' for cognitive ability for GWAS since much larger samples can be utilized compared to neurocognitive studies. (Rietveld et al., 2014a (Rietveld et al., , 2014b (Rietveld et al., , 2013 Martin et al., 2011) The Social Science Genetic Association Consortium (SSGAC) reported on a 126,559 person GWAS that detected three genome-wide significant SNPs associated with completion of college (rs11584700 and rs4851266) and years of schooling (rs9320913). (Rietveld et al., 2013) In a post hoc analysis, these SNPs had a stronger and more direct effect on cognitive function than on education. (Rietveld et al., 2013) Further, a polygenic risk score of educational attainment SNPs accounted for 2-3% of the variance in general cognitive ability an in independent sample, and a mediation analysis suggested that g mediated more than half of the effect these SNPs had on education. (Rietveld et al., 2013) Here, we analyzed the three SNPs obtained in the SSGAC educational attainment GWAS in ≈20,000 independent subjects in the Cognitive Genomics Consortium (COGENT), (Donohoe et al., 2012; Lencz et al., 2013) and found converging evidence across multiple large cohorts that common variation at genomic region 6q16.1, previously associated with years of schooling, reliably predicts variation in g.\"}, {'section_title': 'Methods and Materials', 'text': \"COGENT is an international GWAS collaboration formed to conduct genetic analyses of g and related neurocognitive processes in healthy individuals. (Donohoe et al., 2012) Though common GWAS markers have been proposed to account for ~30% or more of the variance in general intelligence in adults, individual SNPs only contribute a small fraction of the variance to the heritability of g due to extreme polygenicity. Marioni et al., 2014) Detecting SNP associations of such small magnitudes via GWAS requires large samples many times the size an individual lab can ascertain, leading to consortia such as COGENT. The decision to study g in COGENT stemmed from longstanding evidence that a g factor can be derived consistently, captures almost half the variance in overall test performance, and is relatively invariant to the neurocognitive test battery used and specific abilities assessed. Panizzon et al., 2014) The first phase of COGENT ('COGENT1') resulted in a GWAS of general cognitive ability in ≈5,000 individuals from the general population. (Lencz et al., 2013) The next (and ongoing) wave of data collection in COGENT ('COGENT2') has resulted in the acquisition of ≈15,000 independent subjects with neurocognitive and GWAS data for analysis (see Table 1 for cohort details). To be included as a participant in COGENT, data from at least one neuropsychological measure across at least three domains of cognitive performance (e.g., digit span for working memory; logical memory for verbal declarative memory; and digit symbol coding for processing speed), or the use of a validated g-sensitive measure was required. Tests missing for more than 5% of the sample in an individual study were excluded. Each COGENT study administered an average of 10.3 neurocognitive tests, and the internal consistency of performance within each study was strong (mean Cronbach's alpha = 75%; supplementary table S1). The first unrotated principal component accounted for just under half of the variance across the 21 studies on average, as expected based on an extensive prior literature. (Carroll, 1993) As Figure 1 shows, g had normal distributional properties within all 21 studies, a feature critical to enhancing statistical power in quantitative trait analysis.\\nAll COGENT samples were genotyped on commercial Illumina or Affymetrix genome-wide SNP microarrays (supplementary table S1). Standard GWAS quality control (QC) methods were applied to the genetic data (described in detail in the supplementary information). Subjects in the study were Caucasian of European ancestry, which we confirmed by analysis of genotype data using multidimensional scaling (MDS). Genetic outliers were removed in each study based on MDS axis plotting versus HapMap3 ethnic subgroups. Note that none of the three SNPs previously associated with education were variants included on commercially available microarrays, and thus were imputed into their datasets. (Rietveld et al., 2013) In the COGENT1 studies, SNPs were imputed using HapMap3 reference panels as previously described. (Lencz et al., 2013) COGENT2 samples that did not have genotypes for the SNPs of interest were imputed using IMPUTE2 (Howie et al., 2009 ) and 1000 Genomes Project reference panels (downloaded June 2014).\"}, {'section_title': '2011) Plink was used to analyze datasets comprising unrelated individuals', 'text': ', and GCTA used to analyze five datasets in which multiple family members were known to be included a priori. GCTA has implemented a mixed-linear-model association (MLMA) analytic function that corrects for population or relatedness structure through a correction that is specific to the structure of interest. Regression coefficients and standard error estimates were generated within each study and then carried forward for meta-analysis using Metasoft (Han and Eskin, 2011) and the R MetABEL package (Aulchenko et al., 2007) for plotting of results. Although we expected that allelic effects for cognitive ability would mirror the direction observed for educational attainment, all analyses were conservatively carried out using two-tailed tests.\\nA multi-stage approach was utilized to determine if GWAS hits associated with educational attainment were also associated with general cognitive ability in COGENT. First, we examined the p-values of the three educational attainment SNPs (and their close proxies) in the database housing the results of the COGENT1 GWAS. (Lencz et al., 2013) SNPs with pvalues < .05 identified in this first stage were then meta-analyzed for association to g in ≈16,000 independent subjects in the subsequent replication stage.'}, {'section_title': 'Results', 'text': ''}, {'section_title': 'COGENT Analysis', 'text': \"Using the approach described above, the two SNPs previously associated with the dichotomous variable of completing college (rs11584700 and rs4851266) in (Rietveld et al., 2013) were not significantly associated with g in COGENT1 (P's > .05). The third SNP (rs9320913) associated with years of schooling was neither genotyped nor imputed in COGENT1; however, a close proxy SNP (rs1906252, R 2 = 1.0 in HapMap2 CEU, R 2 = .905 in 1000 Genomes CEU) was available for analysis in the COGENT1 GWAS data. rs1906252 was either typed or imputed in all nine COGENT1 studies, and was significantly associated with general cognitive ability in the expected direction, such that the minor (A) allele was associated with higher g scores (β = .050, P = 1.20 × 10 −2 ; P Q = .340). This SNP was therefore carried forward for analysis in COGENT2.\\nTo date, GWAS and neurocognitive data have been acquired for more than 15,000 participants from 12 independent cohorts in COGENT2. The average sample size of individual COGENT2 studies was 1,398 and ranged from 127 to 4,412 Caucasian subjects of European ancestry. rs1906252 was genotyped or imputed in all 12 COGENT2 samples (N = 16,544 genotypes), of which 15,533 had g factor data. As shown in Table 2 , the association between allelic variation at SNP rs1906252 and g in COGENT2 was statistically significant and not biased by heterogeneity (β = .027, P = 2.34 × 10 −3 , two-tailed; P Q = . 671). The direction of the minor allele effect was positive in 10 out of 12 COGENT2 studies, which was consistent with the educational attainment GWAS studies and COGENT1, and statistically different from chance (binomial test, P = .02). Finally, all 21 COGENT datasets were merged to analyze the association between rs1906252 and g in the combined sample of 20,495 individuals. A significant association was again detected in the combined analysis that was not confounded by heterogeneity (β = .031, P = 1.47 × 10 −4 , two-tailed; P Q = .543). Figure 2 presents the combined results in a forest plot, and as shown in Figure 3 , a linear increase in general cognitive ability was related positively to minor A allele load.\\nWe tested the robustness of the association between rs1906252 and g in a series of sensitivity analyses. First, a potential confound worthy of consideration was the fact that two COGENT1 studies (Helsinki Birth Cohort Study [HBCS; n = 332] and the 1936 Lothian Birth Cohort Study [LBC1936; n = 1,005]) (Lencz et al., 2013) were also included in SSGAC. (Rietveld et al., 2014b (Rietveld et al., , 2013 The non-independence of our collective studies and the high correlation between educational attainment and cognition necessitated a sensitivity analysis requiring HBCS and LBC1936 be excluded and the remaining COGENT studies reanalyzed. This analysis also yielded a significant result between variation in rs1906252 and g (β = .026, P = 1.60 × 10 −3 , two-tailed; P Q = .889; see Table 2 ).\\nNext, age had a bimodal distribution across the 21 COGENT studies. The first peak was at approximately 18 years of age, and the second peak at approximately 70 years (supplemental figure S1) . To explore the effect of age on the association between rs1906252 and g across the lifespan, we examined the interaction between rs1906252 and age on g, which was not significant (β = .0004, P = .302). We then split the sample at the 'valley' of the distribution at age 40. This resulted in a group of 7,208 individuals under 40 years of age and a group of 13,287 individuals 40 years of age or older. The interaction between rs1906252 and this dichotomous age split was not significant (β = .007, P = .728). Thus, age did not moderate the association between rs1906252 and general cognitive function across the lifespan in COGENT.\"}, {'section_title': 'SSGAC Meta-Analysis', 'text': 'The SSGAC reanalyzed their GWAS data utilizing a two-stage design in order to examine whether educational attainment is a valid proxy phenotype for cognitive ability. (Rietveld et al., 2014b ) Subjects with available neurocognitive data (n = 24,189) were removed from the larger cohort, and a GWAS of years of education was then conducted in the remaining ~106K participants (Stage 1). The top 69 SNPs associated with educational attainment were then carried forward for analysis in relation to cognitive performance in the ~24K subsample (Stage 2). In Stage 1, the chromosome 6q16.1 locus previously associated with years of schooling was again genome-wide significant for educational attainment, although the top SNP at this locus was slightly different (rs9320913 in the original GWAS and rs1487441 in the second GWAS; R 2 > .9 between the two SNPs). In Stage 2, rs1487441 was the SNP most strongly associated with cognitive performance (P = 1.24 × 10 −4 ).\\nNotably, rs1487441 is a perfect proxy for our SNP, rs1906252 (R 2 = 1 in both HapMap and 1000 Genomes). Thus, we sought to integrate our current results with the most recent SSGAC findings. As shown in Table 3 , we performed a meta-analysis of the SSGAC cognitive subcohort with our fully independent COGENT cohorts. LBC1936 and HBCS were part of the SSGAC studies, so they were excluded for this particular analysis. However, this was a conservative approach since (i) LBC1936 was included in the cognitive performance sample as part of the Childhood Intelligence Consortium, which used age 11 cognitive phenotypes for LBC1936, whereas LBC1936 adult phenotypes were included in COGENT; and (ii) HBCS was not included in the SSGAC cognitive analysis, only the educational attainment GWAS. (Rietveld et al., 2014b ) With a total sample size of 43,381 non-duplicated individuals across SSGAC and COGENT, the association between this locus and g had an estimated effect size of β = .031 (P = 4.94 × 10 −7 ).'}, {'section_title': 'CHARGE Meta-Analysis', 'text': 'A GWAS of general cognitive function that included ≈53,000 individuals from 31 population-based cohorts was recently published by the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) consortium. (Davies et al., 2015) The study reported genome-wide significant SNP associations with general cognitive ability in three genomic regions, including rs1906252 (P = 1.55 × 10 −8 ). We sought to integrate the COGENT findings with the CHARGE findings as well, and conducted a second metaanalysis of rs1906252 and g. In this analytic series, the COGENT samples were fully independent from both the SSGAC and the CHARGE samples. In other words, we excluded HBCS and LBC1936 as above, and excluded additional data from our Framingham Heart Study, Second Generation Cohort (FHS) sample, the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) sample, and the Norwegian Cognitive NeuroGenetics (NCNG) sample, all of which overlapped with CHARGE to some extent. In the reduced COGENT sample of 16 sites and ≈15,000 subjects fully independent from SSGAC and CHARGE, rs1906252 retained a significant association to g (β = .022, P = 2.81 × 10 −2 ). Further, the joint analysis of the 42 independent COGENT and CHARGE cohorts (N ≈ 68,000) was robust (β = .029, P = 1.65 × 10 −9 ).'}, {'section_title': 'Conclusions', 'text': \"The current study identified a significant association of a SNP at chromosome 6q16.1 with general cognitive ability across 21 well-characterized international samples of Europeanancestry individuals from the general population. Sensitivity analysis suggested that the association between rs1906252 and g was significant, independent of the previously published cohorts from the educational attainment GWAS; moreover, the strength of the association was not affected by age of the subjects. In COGENT, the direction of association with g was consistent with the association to self-reported educational attainment in the SSGAC, with more copies of the minor A allele linked to better performance on objectivelymeasured sub-traits that comprise general cognitive ability.\\nBased on the commonly used formula, (Thorleifsson et al., 2009 ) R 2 = 2f(1-f)a 2 , where f is the allele frequency (0.47 in this instance) and a is the additive effect as measured by standardized beta, the independent COGENT cohort produces an estimated effect size of R 2 = .0382% (Table 3 ). This effect size estimate is slightly more than half the value obtained in the SSGAC cognitive subcohort. This is probably due, at least in part, to the 'winner's curse' phenomenon in which initial observations produce inflated effects by chance. (Zollner and Pritchard, 2007) . The present report provides the first estimate of the effect size that is fully independent of the initial discovery cohort. This effect size is approximately an order of magnitude smaller than the largest allelic effect sizes observed for other complex polygenic traits such as height or weight (Visscher et al, 2012; Wood et al, 2014) , possibly due to the inherent noise and heterogeneity in the construction of the g phenotype. However, the success of GWAS for height and weight provide optimism that future, larger GWAS of cognitive ability will prove increasingly successful at identifying significant associations.\\nFor example, the first study reporting a genome-wide significant QTL for height (Weedon et al., 2007) had power of only 3.2% to detect the HMGA2 locus, based on the effect size estimate later derived from an independent cohort that was an order of magnitude larger. (Lango Allen et al., 2010) Similarly, subsequent height GWAS (Weedon et al., 2008) remained underpowered by conventional criteria (1-β = .80) to detect even the strongest loci, yet were still able to obtain genome-wide significance for multiple loci, including those for which power was <1%. This pattern applies to all polygenic complex traits, due to the very large number of loci that are available to be detected, especially given that the number of associated loci tends to increase very rapidly as effect sizes drop. Functionally, rs1906252 is about 700 kilobases from the nearest annotated gene, but it is in an intron of a long intergenic non-coding RNA (lincRNA; transcript ID: RP11-436D23.1; Gene ID: LOC101927335; Ensembl Gene ID: ENSG00000271860) that is expressed in human brain tissue based on searches in BrainSpan (http://www.brainspan.org/) and GeneProf (Halbritter et al., 2012) (http://www.geneprof.org/). In order to identify potential regulatory elements at this genomic locus, we interrogated rs1906252 using HaploReg v3 (Ward and Kellis, 2012) . While rs1906252 is unannotated, it is in nearly perfect LD (R 2 = . 99) with rs77910749, which is highly conserved (by both GERP and SiPhy computations), is a DNase hypersensitivity site in fetal brain, and serves as a weak enhancer or transcription start site across multiple brain tissues. Notably, rs1906252 was recently reported to be a genome-wide significant variant associated with bipolar disorder, (Mühleisen et al., 2014) again providing evidence of the important overlap of general cognitive ability and psychiatric illness; the primary finding of our previous COGENT study was a significant polygenic overlap between SNPs for general cognitive ability and schizophrenia. (Lencz et al., 2013) Additionally, rs1906252 was among the top findings (though not significant after correction for multiple comparisons) in an earlier GWAS of processing speed based on performance on the symbol search test conducted in part in the LBC1936 cohort. Most recently, rs1906252 and 10 other SNPs in this region were associated with general cognitive function in a GWAS of ≈53,000 subjects at a threshold considered to reach genome-wide significance. (Davies et al., 2015) In summary, the current study provides an independent replication of a link between genetic variation at rs1906252 and neurocognitive ability. Results also provide evidence that the proxy phenotype approach of using educational attainment as an indirect measure of cognitive ability for GWAS has external validity.\"}, {'section_title': 'Supplementary Material', 'text': 'Refer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.'}, {'section_title': 'Authors', 'text': \"the Laboratory for Neuro Imaging at the University of Southern California.

Marioni et al., 2014) Detecting SNP associations of such small magnitudes via GWAS requires large samples many times the size an individual lab can ascertain, leading to consortia such as COGENT. The decision to study g in COGENT stemmed from longstanding evidence that a g factor can be derived consistently, captures almost half the variance in overall test performance, and is relatively invariant to the neurocognitive test battery used and specific abilities assessed. Panizzon et al., 2014) The first phase of COGENT ('COGENT1') resulted in a GWAS of general cognitive ability in \\u22485,000 individuals from the general population. (Lencz et al., 2013) The next (and ongoing) wave of data collection in COGENT ('COGENT2') has resulted in the acquisition of \\u224815,000 independent subjects with neurocognitive and GWAS data for analysis (see Table 1 for cohort details). To be included as a participant in COGENT, data from at least one neuropsychological measure across at least three domains of cognitive performance (e.g., digit span for working memory; logical memory for verbal declarative memory; and digit symbol coding for processing speed), or the use of a validated g-sensitive measure was required. Tests missing for more than 5% of the sample in an individual study were excluded. Each COGENT study administered an average of 10.3 neurocognitive tests, and the internal consistency of performance within each study was strong (mean Cronbach's alpha = 75%; supplementary table S1). The first unrotated principal component accounted for just under half of the variance across the 21 studies on average, as expected based on an extensive prior literature. (Carroll, 1993) As Figure 1 shows, g had normal distributional properties within all 21 studies, a feature critical to enhancing statistical power in quantitative trait analysis.\\nAll COGENT samples were genotyped on commercial Illumina or Affymetrix genome-wide SNP microarrays (supplementary table S1). Standard GWAS quality control (QC) methods were applied to the genetic data (described in detail in the supplementary information). Subjects in the study were Caucasian of European ancestry, which we confirmed by analysis of genotype data using multidimensional scaling (MDS). Genetic outliers were removed in each study based on MDS axis plotting versus HapMap3 ethnic subgroups. Note that none of the three SNPs previously associated with education were variants included on commercially available microarrays, and thus were imputed into their datasets. (Rietveld et al., 2013) In the COGENT1 studies, SNPs were imputed using HapMap3 reference panels as previously described. (Lencz et al., 2013) COGENT2 samples that did not have genotypes for the SNPs of interest were imputed using IMPUTE2 (Howie et al., 2009 ) and 1000 Genomes Project reference panels (downloaded June 2014).\"\n",

GCTA has implemented a mixed-linear-model association (MLMA) analytic function that corrects for population or relatedness structure through a correction that is specific to the structure of interest. Regression coefficients and standard error estimates were generated within each study and then carried forward for meta-analysis using Metasoft (Han and Eskin, 2011) and the R MetABEL package (Aulchenko et al., 2007) for plotting of results. Although we expected that allelic effects for cognitive ability would mirror the direction observed for educational attainment, all analyses were conservatively carried out using two-tailed tests.\\nA multi-stage approach was utilized to determine if GWAS hits associated with educational attainment were also associated with general cognitive ability in COGENT. First, we examined the p-values of the three educational attainment SNPs (and their close proxies) in the database housing the results of the COGENT1 GWAS. (Lencz et al., 2013) SNPs with pvalues < .05 identified in this first stage were then meta-analyzed for association to g in \\u224816,000 independent subjects in the subsequent replication stage.\"\n",

The third SNP (rs9320913) associated with years of schooling was neither genotyped nor imputed in COGENT1; however, a close proxy SNP (rs1906252, R 2 = 1.0 in HapMap2 CEU, R 2 = .905 in 1000 Genomes CEU) was available for analysis in the COGENT1 GWAS data. rs1906252 was either typed or imputed in all nine COGENT1 studies, and was significantly associated with general cognitive ability in the expected direction, such that the minor (A) allele was associated with higher g scores (\\u03b2 = .050, P = 1.20 \\u00d7 10 \\u22122 ; P Q = .340). This SNP was therefore carried forward for analysis in COGENT2.\\nTo date, GWAS and neurocognitive data have been acquired for more than 15,000 participants from 12 independent cohorts in COGENT2. The average sample size of individual COGENT2 studies was 1,398 and ranged from 127 to 4,412 Caucasian subjects of European ancestry. rs1906252 was genotyped or imputed in all 12 COGENT2 samples (N = 16,544 genotypes), of which 15,533 had g factor data. As shown in Table 2 , the association between allelic variation at SNP rs1906252 and g in COGENT2 was statistically significant and not biased by heterogeneity (\\u03b2 = .027, P = 2.34 \\u00d7 10 \\u22123 , two-tailed; P Q = . 671). The direction of the minor allele effect was positive in 10 out of 12 COGENT2 studies, which was consistent with the educational attainment GWAS studies and COGENT1, and statistically different from chance (binomial test, P = .02). Finally, all 21 COGENT datasets were merged to analyze the association between rs1906252 and g in the combined sample of 20,495 individuals. A significant association was again detected in the combined analysis that was not confounded by heterogeneity (\\u03b2 = .031, P = 1.47 \\u00d7 10 \\u22124 , two-tailed; P Q = .543). Figure 2 presents the combined results in a forest plot, and as shown in Figure 3 , a linear increase in general cognitive ability was related positively to minor A allele load.\\nWe tested the robustness of the association between rs1906252 and g in a series of sensitivity analyses. First, a potential confound worthy of consideration was the fact that two COGENT1 studies (Helsinki Birth Cohort Study [HBCS; n = 332] and the 1936 Lothian Birth Cohort Study [LBC1936; n = 1,005]) (Lencz et al., 2013) were also included in SSGAC. (Rietveld et al., 2014b (Rietveld et al., , 2013 The non-independence of our collective studies and the high correlation between educational attainment and cognition necessitated a sensitivity analysis requiring HBCS and LBC1936 be excluded and the remaining COGENT studies reanalyzed. This analysis also yielded a significant result between variation in rs1906252 and g (\\u03b2 = .026, P = 1.60 \\u00d7 10 \\u22123 , two-tailed; P Q = .889; see Table 2 ).\\nNext, age had a bimodal distribution across the 21 COGENT studies. The first peak was at approximately 18 years of age, and the second peak at approximately 70 years (supplemental figure S1) . To explore the effect of age on the association between rs1906252 and g across the lifespan, we examined the interaction between rs1906252 and age on g, which was not significant (\\u03b2 = .0004, P = .302). We then split the sample at the 'valley' of the distribution at age 40. This resulted in a group of 7,208 individuals under 40 years of age and a group of 13,287 individuals 40 years of age or older. The interaction between rs1906252 and this dichotomous age split was not significant (\\u03b2 = .007, P = .728). Thus, age did not moderate the association between rs1906252 and general cognitive function across the lifespan in COGENT.\"\n",

(Rietveld et al., 2014b ) Subjects with available neurocognitive data (n = 24,189) were removed from the larger cohort, and a GWAS of years of education was then conducted in the remaining ~106K participants (Stage 1). The top 69 SNPs associated with educational attainment were then carried forward for analysis in relation to cognitive performance in the ~24K subsample (Stage 2). In Stage 1, the chromosome 6q16.1 locus previously associated with years of schooling was again genome-wide significant for educational attainment, although the top SNP at this locus was slightly different (rs9320913 in the original GWAS and rs1487441 in the second GWAS; R 2 > .9 between the two SNPs). In Stage 2, rs1487441 was the SNP most strongly associated with cognitive performance (P = 1.24 \\u00d7 10 \\u22124 ).\\nNotably, rs1487441 is a perfect proxy for our SNP, rs1906252 (R 2 = 1 in both HapMap and 1000 Genomes). Thus, we sought to integrate our current results with the most recent SSGAC findings. As shown in Table 3 , we performed a meta-analysis of the SSGAC cognitive subcohort with our fully independent COGENT cohorts. LBC1936 and HBCS were part of the SSGAC studies, so they were excluded for this particular analysis. However, this was a conservative approach since (i) LBC1936 was included in the cognitive performance sample as part of the Childhood Intelligence Consortium, which used age 11 cognitive phenotypes for LBC1936, whereas LBC1936 adult phenotypes were included in COGENT; and (ii) HBCS was not included in the SSGAC cognitive analysis, only the educational attainment GWAS. (Rietveld et al., 2014b ) With a total sample size of 43,381 non-duplicated individuals across SSGAC and COGENT, the association between this locus and g had an estimated effect size of \\u03b2 = .031 (P = 4.94 \\u00d7 10 \\u22127 ).\"\n",

      "        \"text\": \"The current study identified a significant association of a SNP at chromosome 6q16.1 with general cognitive ability across 21 well-characterized international samples of Europeanancestry individuals from the general population. Sensitivity analysis suggested that the association between rs1906252 and g was significant, independent of the previously published cohorts from the educational attainment GWAS; moreover, the strength of the association was not affected by age of the subjects. In COGENT, the direction of association with g was consistent with the association to self-reported educational attainment in the SSGAC, with more copies of the minor A allele linked to better performance on objectivelymeasured sub-traits that comprise general cognitive ability.\\nBased on the commonly used formula, (Thorleifsson et al., 2009 ) R 2 = 2f(1-f)a 2 , where f is the allele frequency (0.47 in this instance) and a is the additive effect as measured by standardized beta, the independent COGENT cohort produces an estimated effect size of R 2 = .0382% (Table 3 ). This effect size estimate is slightly more than half the value obtained in the SSGAC cognitive subcohort. This is probably due, at least in part, to the 'winner's curse' phenomenon in which initial observations produce inflated effects by chance. (Zollner and Pritchard, 2007) . The present report provides the first estimate of the effect size that is fully independent of the initial discovery cohort. This effect size is approximately an order of magnitude smaller than the largest allelic effect sizes observed for other complex polygenic traits such as height or weight (Visscher et al, 2012; Wood et al, 2014) , possibly due to the inherent noise and heterogeneity in the construction of the g phenotype. However, the success of GWAS for height and weight provide optimism that future, larger GWAS of cognitive ability will prove increasingly successful at identifying significant associations.\\nFor example, the first study reporting a genome-wide significant QTL for height (Weedon et al., 2007) had power of only 3.2% to detect the HMGA2 locus, based on the effect size estimate later derived from an independent cohort that was an order of magnitude larger. (Lango Allen et al., 2010) Similarly, subsequent height GWAS (Weedon et al., 2008) remained underpowered by conventional criteria (1-\\u03b2 = .80) to detect even the strongest loci, yet were still able to obtain genome-wide significance for multiple loci, including those for which power was <1%. This pattern applies to all polygenic complex traits, due to the very large number of loci that are available to be detected, especially given that the number of associated loci tends to increase very rapidly as effect sizes drop. Functionally, rs1906252 is about 700 kilobases from the nearest annotated gene, but it is in an intron of a long intergenic non-coding RNA (lincRNA; transcript ID: RP11-436D23.1; Gene ID: LOC101927335; Ensembl Gene ID: ENSG00000271860) that is expressed in human brain tissue based on searches in BrainSpan (http://www.brainspan.org/) and GeneProf (Halbritter et al., 2012) (http://www.geneprof.org/). In order to identify potential regulatory elements at this genomic locus, we interrogated rs1906252 using HaploReg v3 (Ward and Kellis, 2012) . While rs1906252 is unannotated, it is in nearly perfect LD (R 2 = . 99) with rs77910749, which is highly conserved (by both GERP and SiPhy computations), is a DNase hypersensitivity site in fetal brain, and serves as a weak enhancer or transcription start site across multiple brain tissues. Notably, rs1906252 was recently reported to be a genome-wide significant variant associated with bipolar disorder, (M\\u00fchleisen et al., 2014) again providing evidence of the important overlap of general cognitive ability and psychiatric illness; the primary finding of our previous COGENT study was a significant polygenic overlap between SNPs for general cognitive ability and schizophrenia. (Lencz et al., 2013) Additionally, rs1906252 was among the top findings (though not significant after correction for multiple comparisons) in an earlier GWAS of processing speed based on performance on the symbol search test conducted in part in the LBC1936 cohort. Most recently, rs1906252 and 10 other SNPs in this region were associated with general cognitive function in a GWAS of \\u224853,000 subjects at a threshold considered to reach genome-wide significance. (Davies et al., 2015) In summary, the current study provides an independent replication of a link between genetic variation at rs1906252 and neurocognitive ability. Results also provide evidence that the proxy phenotype approach of using educational attainment as an indirect measure of cognitive ability for GWAS has external validity.\"\n",

School principals' uses of summative achievement data results from PISA indicate that in 2006, at least 90 percent of 15-year-old students in the United States and the United Kingdom had principals who reported that school achievement data were posted publicly (e.g., in the media). This compares to 75 percent of students in the russian Federation, 64 percent in Canada, and 33 percent in Italy. In Germany and Japan, 14 and 11 percent of students, respectively, had principals who reported that school achievement data were posted publicly. A greater percentage of 15-year-olds in the United States than in all other reporting G-8 countries had principals who reported that school achievement data were used in decisions about instructional resource allocation to the school; in the United States, 79 percent of students had principals who reported this use. At least 90 percent of students in Canada, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the russian Federation had principals who reported that school achievement data were tracked over time by an administrative authority (such as a district, state, or national education agency (indicator 20).\"}, {'section_title': 'Frequency of behavior problems', 'text': 'results from TIMSS indicate that in 2007, the percentage of eighth-graders in schools whose principals reported at least a weekly occurrence of a classroom disturbance ranged from 8 percent in Japan to 60 percent in Scotland, with the United States at 55 percent.

Since the 1960s, the united States has participated actively in international projects that are designed to provide key information about the performance of the u.S. education system relative to education systems in other countries. these projects include the Indicators of national Education Systems (InES) at the organization for Economic cooperation and development (oEcd); the Progress in International reading Literacy Study (PIrLS); the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA); and the trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (tIMSS). this report, Comparative Indicators of Education in the United States and Other G-8 Countries: 2009, draws on the most current information available from most of these projects at the time the report was being produced (in the summer and fall of 2008) to present a set of education indicators that describes how the u.S. education system compares with education systems in other economically developed countries. updated information from these various projects will be incorporated in subsequent reports. Although the international education projects cited above involve many countries worldwide, the comparisons in this report focus on the Group of Eight (G-8) countries: canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the russian Federation, the united Kingdom, and the united States. these are among the most industrialized countries in the world. the G 8 countries were selected as a comparison group because of the similarities in their economic development and because the other G-8 countries are among the major economic partners of the united States. the leaders of these countries meet regularly to discuss economic and other policy issues. What 's New in 2009? this report is the fourth in a series of reports published by the national center for Education Statistics (ncES) that describes how the education system in the united States compares with education systems in the other G-8 countries. It is the first of these reports to include data from all three international assessments of students in which the united States regularly participates-PIrLS, PISA, and tIMSS. the indicators use 2006 data from PIrLS and PISA and 2007 data from tIMSS. Many of the indicators in this report are updates of previous indicators that used data from earlier cycles, such as tIMSS 1999 and PIrLS 2001. there are also a few new PIrLS indicators-one presenting data using the PIrLS international performance benchmarks, another reporting the amount of time spent on reading instruction at school, and another highlighting trends in teacher preparation and experience. the PISA indicators, in particular, offer a unique contribution to the series of Comparative Indicators reports. PISA is a system of international assessments that measures 15-year-old students' performance in reading literacy, mathematics literacy, and science literacy every 3 years. Although all three of these subject areas are assessed in each PISA data collection effort, one is assessed in depth (i.e., is considered the major subject area) on a rotating basis. the major subject area in 2000 (when PISA was initiated) was reading literacy; in 2003, it was mathematics literacy. thus, prior Comparative Indicators reports have focused on 15-year-old students' reading and mathematics performance. the current report features indicators pertaining to students' science performance, as assessed in the most recent (2006) study. the 2008 edition of Education at a Glance, which presents international education data compiled by oEcd, was used largely to update several indicators that have been presented previously. However, this resource was also used to produce a new indicator in this report: teachers' working time.\"}, {'section_title': 'Education Levels Used for the Indicators', 'text': \"Many of the indicators in this report refer to at least one of the following education levels: preprimary education, primary education, secondary education, and higher education. A brief overview of the education levels is presented here to provide the reader with a frame of reference while reading the indicators (see appendix A for more detailed descriptions). to ensure comparability in the indicators across countries, each country restructured its national education data to correspond with the definitions of education levels that were developed in the 1997 revision of the International Standard classification of Education (IScEd97) (united nations Educational, Scientific and cultural organization [unESco] 1997). the following descriptions highlight the key features of (1) education programs from preprimary through secondary education and (2) higher education programs. Preprimary education includes programs of education for children at least 3 years of age that involve organized, center-based instructional activities; in most countries, preprimary education is not compulsory. Primary education includes programs that are designed to give students a sound basic education in reading, writing, and mathematics, along with an elementary understanding of other subjects, such as history, geography, science, art, and music. In the international classification, primary education usually begins at the start of compulsory education (around age 6) and lasts for 6 years. Secondary education encompasses two stages: lower secondary education and upper secondary education. Lower secondary education includes programs that are designed to complete basic education; the standard duration in the international classification is 3 years. Upper secondary education is designed to provide students with more in-depth knowledge of academic or vocational subjects and to prepare them for higher level academic or vocational studies or entry into the labor market. The standard duration of upper secondary education in the international classification is 3 years. Higher education includes tertiary programs 1 that fall into three main categories: Academic higher education below the doctoral level. • These largely theory-based programs are intended to provide sufficient qualifications to gain entry into advanced research programs and professions with high skill requirements. To be classified as such, a degree program must last at least 3 years and is typically preceded by at least 13 years of formal schooling. In the United States, bachelor's, master's, and first professional degree programs are classified at this level. Vocational higher education. • These programs provide a higher level of career and technical education and are designed to prepare students for the labor market. In the international classification, these programs last 2 to 4 years. In the United States, associate's degree programs are classified at this level. Doctoral level of academic higher education. • These programs usually require the completion of a research thesis or dissertation. The international classification also includes an education level that straddles the boundary between upper secondary and higher education: postsecondary nontertiary education. These programs of study-which are primarily vocational in nature-are generally taken after the completion of upper secondary education. They are often not significantly more advanced than upper secondary programs, but they serve to broaden the knowledge of participants who have already completed upper secondary education. In the United States, these programs are often in the form of occupationally specific vocational certificate programs, such as 1-year certification programs offered at technical institutes or community colleges. 2 Mapping G-8 Countries' Education Systems to the ISCED97 Matching the education levels of individual countries to the ISCED97 classification can be challenging, because the particulars of individual countries seldom fit ISCED97 perfectly. Using ISCED97 classifications as a starting point, NCES worked with education professionals in other G-8 countries to create a general overview of each country's education system. As an aid to the reader, schematics of how the ISCED97 applies to each of the G-8 countries are provided in appendix A, accompanied by text describing each system in greater detail.\"}, {'section_title': 'Organization of the Report', 'text': \"The report begins with a summary section that highlights key findings; it then presents 27 indicators that compare different aspects of the education system in the United States to education systems in other G-8 countries. The indicators are organized into the following sections: population and school enrollment; • academic performance, with subsections for reading, mathemat-• ics, and science; context for learning; • expenditure for education; and • education returns: educational attainment and income. • The first section, population and school enrollment, presents indicators that suggest the potential demand for education in countries as measured by the size and growth of their school-age population and current levels of enrollment in formal education. The section concludes with an indicator that examines the extent to which foreign students are enrolled in higher education across the G-8 countries. The next section, academic performance, has indicators grouped by subject area into three subsections: reading, mathematics, and science. The indicators present findings on student performance in the G-8 countries, including achievement differences across key demographic variables such as sex, parent occupational status, and immigrant status. The third section highlights a range of key policy-relevant issues pertaining to the context for learning across the G-8 countries. For example, using data as reported by school teachers, there are indicators pertaining to the amount of time devoted to reading instruction, strategies used to assist students who have fallen behind in reading, trends in teacher preparation and experience, teachers' working time, and teacher professional development in mathematics and science. This section also presents the reports of school principals on the uses of summative achievement data and the frequency of student behavior problems. The fourth section provides a comparative look at expenditure for education, including breakdowns by expenditure as a percentage of a country's gross domestic product (GDP) and an indicator on public school teacher salaries in primary and secondary education. The final section, education returns: educational attainment and income, focuses on educational attainment, employment rates, and earnings (including breakdowns by sex and field of study). Each indicator is presented in a two-page format. The first page presents key findings that highlight how the United States compares with its G-8 peers (with data available) on the issue examined in the indicator. The key findings are followed by a section that defines the terms used in the indicator and describes key features of the methodology used to produce it. The second page presents graphical depictions of the data that support the key findings. These tables and/or figures also include the specific data source for the indicator and more detailed notes on interpreting the data.\"}, {'section_title': 'Data Sources', 'text': \"There are four main sources of data for this report: Data from the INES project come from tables in Education at a Glance: OECD Indicators 2008 or from OECD's online Education Database. These data are derived from annual data collections carried out by OECD, with member countries' data coming from a variety of national data sources, including administrative data collections, school surveys, household surveys, and national financial reports. Most of the indicator data for the United States come from the Current Population Survey (CPS) of the U.S. Census Bureau, the NCES Common Core of Data (CCD), the NCES Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), and the NCES Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS).\"}, {'section_title': 'PIRLS 2006 data. •', 'text': 'PIrLS is conducted by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA) and is an assessment of fourth-graders in reading literacy.

Data for indicator 1, on school-age population, are from the International Data Base (IDB) of the U.S. Census Bureau. Throughout this report, student data are often presented. Some indicators show the mean scores of students (e.g., indicators 5 and 10), • the percentage of students meeting certain criteria, such as • the percentage of students reaching established achievement benchmarks (e.g., indicators 6 and 11), or the percentage of students with particular characteristics, • such as the percentage of students by immigrant status (indicator 13). Other indicators also use the student as the unit of analysis, but the data are reported from other sources. These include school principals, such as the percentage of students whose • principals reported that they used summative achievement data in various ways (indicator 20) or teachers, such as the percentage of students whose teachers • reported participating in various professional development activities (indicators 18 and 19). In several other indicators, the unit of analysis is not the student. For example, the unit of analysis may be the teacher, as in public school teachers' salaries (indicator 22) • or postsecondary degrees, as in first university degrees by field of • study (indicator 25). When interpreting the data presented in this report, it is important for readers to be aware of limitations based on the source of information and problems that may exist in verifying comparability in reporting. Except for indicator 22, which explicitly states that the data pertain to public school teachers only, the indicators in this report include data from both public and private schools.\"}, {'section_title': 'Availability of Country Data', 'text': 'It should be noted that many of the indicators in this report do not contain data for the complete set of G-8 countries. That is, specific countries are sometimes not included or are only partially included in an indicator. This is the result of source data not being reported, or specific countries or jurisdictions within a country not participating in a particular survey. For example, Japan did not participate in PIrLS 2006, France did not participate in TIMSS 2007, and Germany did not participate in TIMSS 2007 at the eighth grade; therefore, these countries do not appear in indicators using these data. Two other countries that warrant special mention include Canada and the United Kingdom. Canada participated as a unified country in PISA 2006, and in this report, data for Canada are shown and discussed in the PISA indicators. However, in PIrLS 2006, Canada participated as separate provinces. In this report, results for the Canadian provinces are not reported in the PIrLS indicators; rather, they can be found in the appendix tables (see appendix B). In TIMSS 2007, some Canadian provinces took part in the study as benchmarking participants. These findings do not appear in this report, but they can be found in the international reports published by IEA (Mullis, Martin, and Foy 2008;Martin, Mullis, and Foy 2008). The United Kingdom, which includes England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales, participated in PISA 2006. However, in PIrLS 2006and TIMSS 2007 England and Scotland participated, and they participated as separate jurisdictions. Northern Ireland and Wales did not participate in PIrLS 2006or TIMSS 2007 In this report, the PISA indicators include data for the United Kingdom, and the PIrLS and TIMSS indicators include data for England and Scotland shown separately. Thus, as discussed in indicators using PIrLS data, the participating G-8 countries include England, France, Germany, Italy, the russian Federation, Scotland, and the United States. In indicators using TIMSS data, participating G-8 countries include England, Germany, Italy, Japan, the russian Federation, Scotland, and the United States at fourth grade, and England, Italy, Japan, the russian Federation, Scotland, and the United States at eighth grade. 3 In indicators using INES data, the reporting G-8 countries vary somewhat; these are shown in each indicator. While every effort was made to use the most up-to-date data available across the G-8 countries (usually from 2006 or 2007), data from earlier years were sometimes used if more recent data were not available. To make this clear to the reader, these occurrences are noted in relevant tables and figures.'}, {'section_title': 'Data Quality and Response Rates', 'text': 'PIrLS, PISA, and TIMSS have established technical standards of data quality including participation and response rate standards that countries must meet in order to be included in the comparative results. response rate standards were set using composites of response rates at the school, classroom, student, and teacher levels, and response rates were calculated with and without the inclusion of substitute schools that were selected to replace schools refusing to participate. 4 These standards are described in detail in the technical reports (Martin, Mullis, and Kennedy 2007;OECD 2009;Olson, Martin, and Mullis 2008). Consistent with NCES statistical standards, item response rates less than 85 percent are footnoted in the tables and figures of this report, as well as instances where reporting standards are not met because of too few observations to provide reliable estimates.'}, {'section_title': 'Statistical Testing', 'text': \"Ten of the indicators presented in this report (indicators 1, 2, 3, 17, and 22-27) are derived either from administrative records that are based on universe collections or from national sample surveys for which standard errors were not available. Consequently, for these indicators, no tests of statistical significance were conducted to establish whether observed differences from the U.S. average were statistically significant. However, for the 17 other indicators derived from PIrLS, PISA, or TIMSS data (indicators 4-16 and 18-21), standard t tests were calculated for comparisons of estimates within or between countries (e.g., to test whether a U.S. estimate is statistically different from other G-8 countries' estimates). Differences were reported if they were found to be statistically significant at the .05 level, using two-tailed tests of significance for comparisons of independent samples.\"}, {'section_title': 'Other International Indicator Publications', 'text': 'Prior to this report, NCES produced three earlier reports-in 2006, 2004, and 2002-describing  In 2008, the total population across the G-8 countries ranged from 33.2 million in Canada to 303.8 million in the United States, and the population of 5-to 29-year-olds (roughly the population most likely to be enrolled in education) ranged from 10.4 million in Canada to 104.2 million in the United States (table 1). The population of 5-to 29-year-olds represented 34 percent of the total population in the United States (table 2). In the other G-8 countries, the corresponding percentages ranged from 25 percent in Italy to 33 percent in the russian Federation. From 1998 to 2008, the United States had the largest net percentage gain in population size of 5-to 29-year-olds (6 percent) among the G-8 countries (figure 1). The population of 5-to 29-year-olds declined in every other G-8 country except for Canada, with decreases from 1998 to 2008 ranging from 1 percent in the United Kingdom to 18 percent in Japan. In Canada, growth of this population was essentially flat (0.4 percent). The subpopulation of 5-to 19-year-olds (which generally includes individuals of primary-and secondary-school age) represented 20 percent of the total population in the United States in 2008 (table 2).

The population of 5-to 19-year-olds declined in all other G-8 countries, with decreases from 1998 to 2008 ranging from 1 percent in France to 32 percent in the russian Federation. The subpopulation of 20-to 29-year-olds (which generally includes individuals of postsecondary education age) represented 14 percent of the total population in the United States in 2008, below the percentage in the russian Federation (17 percent) (table 2). The percentages in the other G-8 countries were slightly lower than in the United States, ranging from 11 percent in Italy to 13 percent in Canada, the United Kingdom, and France. The russian Federation had the largest net percentage gain in subpopulation size of 20-to 29-year-olds, an increase of 14 percent from 1998 to 2008 (figure 1). The United States had the second largest net percentage gain in subpopulation size (11 percent). Among the other G-8 countries, Canada and the United Kingdom experienced a net percentage gain from 1998 to 2008 (7 and 1 percent, respectively), while the other G-8 countries experienced declines over this period, ranging from 5 percent in France to 28 percent in Italy.'}, {'section_title': 'Definitions and Methodology', 'text': 'In each country, the percentage of the population of 5-to 29-yearolds in 1998 and 2008 is calculated by dividing the population of 5-to 29-year-olds by the total population. The percentage change in the population of 5-to 29-year-olds is calculated by subtracting the population of 5-to 29-year-olds in 1998 from this population in 2008 and dividing by the 1998 population of 5-to 29-year-olds. These calculations are applied in the same way to the age groups 5 to 19 and 20 to 29. The age group (e.g., 5 to 29) as a percentage of the total population may have declined from 1998 to 2008 even though the size of the age group may have increased. This is because of a higher rate of increase of the total population compared to the rate of increase for the specific population age group.      In 2006, all or almost all 3-and 4-year-old children were enrolled in preprimary or primary education programs in France and Italy (table 3). In Germany, the United Kingdom, and Japan, at least 80 percent of 3-and 4-year-olds were enrolled in preprimary or primary education programs; in the United States, 48 percent were enrolled. Beginning at age 6 in the United States and at age 7 in the russian Federation, at least 90 percent of the population was enrolled in formal education (figure 2). In 2006, the United States and most other reporting G-8 countries had nearly universal school participation of children ages 5-14-the age range that typically corresponds with primary and lower secondary education (table 3). In the russian Federation, 82 percent of 5-to 14-year-olds were enrolled in formal education programs; all other G-8 countries were at 98 percent participation or higher. The United States had an enrollment rate of 78 percent in 2006 for youth ages 15-19-the age range that corresponds most closely with upper secondary education. The U.S. rate was lower than the rates in Italy (81 percent), France (86 percent), and Germany (89 percent), but higher than the rates in the russian Federation (74 percent) and the United Kingdom (70 percent). Compulsory education ends at age 18 in Germany, age 17 in the United States, age 16 in France and the United Kingdom, and age 15 in Italy, Japan, and the russian Federation (figure 2). 5 While participation rates were at 90 percent or higher through the end of compulsory education in Italy, the russian Federation, France, and Japan, they fell below this level in Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Enrollment rates for 20-to 29-year olds-the age range that corresponds most closely to the typical age of enrollment in higher education-were less than 30 percent among the six G-8 countries reporting data (table 3). The United States had an enrollment rate of 23 percent for this age range. The U.S. rate was lower than the rate in Germany (28 percent), but higher than the rates in Italy and France (both at 20 percent), the russian Federation (19 percent), and the United Kingdom (17 percent).\\nThe percentage of the population at given ages enrolled in education is called an \"enrollment rate.\" In this indicator, the term \"enrollment rate\" refers to the \"net enrollment rate\" and is defined as the number of students in a particular age group enrolled in education divided by the population of that same age group. The reference year is 2006 for population and enrollment data in all countries except the russian Federation, which has a reference year of 2005. Enrollment rates may exceed 100 percent for some countries and some age categories largely because of different reference dates for school enrollment and population data. Enrollments include all full-time and part-time students in public and private institutions. Enrollment in preprimary education programs (generally the 3-to 4-year-old age group) includes only children in preschool, nursery, or center-based daycare programs and excludes children in daycare operated in homes. The ending age of compulsory education is the age at which individuals are no longer legally required to participate in formal education. 2   Table 3.

NOTE: Reference year is 2006 for population and enrollment data in all countries except the Russian Federation, as noted above; however, reference dates may differ within that year. Thus, percentages shown in the table are approximations. As described in the source cited below, enrollment rates for some countries were reported as slightly exceeding 100 percent in one or more age ranges (e.g., see 5-to 14-year-olds) due to different reference dates for school enrollment and population data. Enrollment in formal education at the preprimary education level includes children in center-based programs and excludes children in home-based early childhood education.

Over the past 3 decades, the number of foreign students (i.e., students enrolled outside their country of citizenship) in higher education has grown almost fivefold: from 0.6 million worldwide in 1975 to 2.9 million in 2006 (OECD 2008a). In 2006, G-8 countries (as countries of destination) hosted close to two-thirds of all foreign students in higher education (figure 3a). The United States received the largest percentage of these foreign students (20 percent), followed by the United Kingdom (11 percent), Germany (9 percent), and France (9 percent). Altogether, in 2006, these four G-8 countries accounted for almost one-half of all foreign students enrolled in higher education. The other G-8 countries each took in between 2 and 5 percent of all foreign students enrolled in higher education. In addition to the share of foreign students hosted by each G-8 country, another measure can be examined that takes into account the size of a country\\'s higher education system: the percentage of a country\\'s students enrolled in higher education who are foreign students. Among the G-8 countries, the United States had the largest number of foreign students enrolled in higher education (OECD 2008a). However, in comparison to the United States, foreign students made up a larger percentage of enrollments in higher education in the United Kingdom (18 percent), Canada (15 percent), Germany (11 percent), and France (11 percent) (figure 3b). In the United States, nonresidents made up 3 percent of the total enrollment in higher education. 6 In the russian Federation, foreign students made up 1 percent of the total enrollment in higher education, lower than in all other G-8 countries.\\nForeign students are defined as noncitizens enrolled in education programs in a host country, and thus some permanent residents are included. International students are defined as students who enrolled in institutions in other countries, and thus do not include permanent residents.

Except where otherwise noted, data shown include ISCED97 levels 5A (academic higher education below the doctoral level), 5B (vocational higher education), and 6 (doctoral level of academic higher education). For more information on the ISCED97 levels, see appendix A in this report. \\nIn PIrLS 2006, countries were required to sample students in the grade that corresponded to the end of 4 years of formal schooling, providing that the mean age at the time of testing was at least 9.5 years. As defined by PIrLS, the 1st year of formal schooling begins with the 1st year of primary school (ISCED97 level 1), which should mark the beginning of formal instruction in reading, writing, and mathematics. Note that kindergarten is not counted. For most countries, the target grade was fourth grade, or its national equivalent. PIrLS scores are reported on a scale from 0 to 1,000 with the scale average fixed at 500 and the standard deviation fixed at 100. Since the PIrLS reading achievement scales were designed to reliably measure student achievement over time, the metric of the scales was established originally with the 2001 assessment. In order to describe concretely the knowledge and skills attained along the performance scale, PIrLS 2006 established four international achievement benchmarks in reading literacy (low, intermediate, high, and advanced). These benchmarks are identical to the cutpoints used for the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS). Information about the rationale underlying the benchmarks and the procedures used to set the cutpoints is available in Martin, Mullis, and Kennedy (2007). Four points on the scales were identified for use as international benchmarks: 400 for the low benchmark, 475 for the intermediate benchmark, 550 for the high benchmark, and 625 for the advanced benchmark. These were selected to represent the range of performance shown by students internationally.  1 Met international guidelines for participation rates only after substitute schools were included. That is, to avoid sample size losses resulting from sampled schools not participating, a mechanism was instituted to identify, a priori, substitute schools that have similar characteristics to the sampled schools that they may replace. SOURCE: Mullis, I.V.S., Martin, M.O., Kennedy, A.M., and Foy, P. (2007) In 2006, average scores of fourth-grade females in reading literacy were higher than the average scores of fourth-grade males in all participating G-8 countries. Among countries with the largest score differences between males and females were Scotland (538 for females vs. 516 for males), with a difference of 22 points; England (549 for females vs. 530 for males), with a difference of 19 points; and the russian Federation (572 for females vs. 557 for males), with a difference of 15 points ( figure 5a and figure 5b). Among countries with the smallest differences related to sex were Germany (551 for females vs. 544 for males) and Italy (555 for females vs. 548 for males), both with a difference of 7 points. In the United States, females outperformed males by 10 points (545 for females vs. 535 for males).\\nIn PIrLS 2006, countries were required to sample students in the grade that corresponded to the end of 4 years of formal schooling, providing that the mean age at the time of testing was at least 9.5 years.

(2007) On the TIMSS 2007 fourth-grade mathematics assessment, students in Japan outperformed students in the other participating G-8 countries, with higher percentages of Japanese fourth-graders reaching each of the four international benchmarks. The highest international benchmark, advanced, was reached by 23 percent of Japan\\'s fourth-graders in mathematics, compared with percentages ranging from 4 percent in Scotland to 16 percent in the russian Federation and England (figure 6). In the United States, 10 percent of fourth-graders reached the advanced benchmark. The percentage in the United States was higher than in Germany, Italy, and Scotland, but lower than in the russian Federation, England, and Japan. In Japan, 61 percent of fourth-graders reached the high benchmark in mathematics; the percentages in the other G-8 countries ranged from 25 percent in Scotland to 48 percent in England and the russian Federation. In the United States, 40 percent of fourth-graders reached the high benchmark, a larger percentage than in Italy and Scotland but smaller than in England, the russian Federation, and Japan. As at fourth grade, eighth-graders in Japan outperformed their peers in the other participating G-8 countries, with higher percentages of Japanese eighth-graders reaching each of the four benchmarks. The advanced benchmark was reached by 26 percent of Japan\\'s eighth-graders in mathematics, compared with percentages ranging from 3 percent in Italy to 8 percent in the russian Federation and England. In the United States, 6 percent of eighth-graders reached the advanced benchmark. The percentage in the United States was higher than in Scotland and Italy, but lower than in the russian Federation and Japan. In Japan, 61 percent of eighth-graders reached the high benchmark in mathematics; the percentages in the other G-8 countries ranged from 17 percent in Italy to 35 percent in England. In the United States, 31 percent of eighth-graders reached the high benchmark, a larger percentage than in Scotland and Italy.\\nIn TIMSS 2007 at fourth grade, countries were required to sample students in the grade that corresponded to the end of 4 years of formal schooling (the end of primary school), providing that the mean age at the time of testing was at least 9.5 years. At eighth grade, countries were required to sample students in the grade that corresponded to the end of 8 years of formal schooling (the end of lower secondary education), providing that the mean age at the time of testing was at least 13.5 years. TIMSS scores are reported on a scale from 0 to 1,000 with the scale average fixed at 500 and the standard deviation fixed at 100. Since the TIMSS mathematics achievement scales were designed to reliably measure student achievement over time, the metric of the scales was established originally with the 1995 assessment. In order to describe concretely the knowledge and skills attained along the performance scales, TIMSS established four international achievement benchmarks in mathematics and science (low, intermediate, high, and advanced). Four points on the scales were identified for use as international benchmarks: 400 for the low benchmark, 475 for the intermediate benchmark, 550 for the high benchmark, and 625 for the advanced benchmark. These were selected to represent the range of performance shown by students internationally. At the fourth-grade level in mathematics, students at the low benchmark have some basic mathematical knowledge, such as an understanding of whole numbers and the properties of basic geometric shapes. At the intermediate benchmark, students can apply basic mathematical knowledge in straightforward situations, such as performing operations with 3-and 4-digit numbers and decimals and extending simple patterns. At the high benchmark, students can apply their knowledge and understanding to solve multistep word problems involving addition, multiplication, and division and problems requiring the use of data in tables and graphs. Students at the advanced benchmark can apply their understanding and knowledge in a wide variety of relatively complex situations to solve problems involving fractions, decimals, proportions, area, and rotation. At the eighth-grade level in mathematics, students at the low benchmark have some basic mathematical knowledge, such as the ability to do basic computations with whole numbers and reading information from a line on a graph. At the intermediate benchmark, students can apply basic mathematical knowledge in straightforward situations. For example, they can understand simple algebraic relationships, interpret graphs and tables, and perform basic computations to solve one-step word problems involving whole numbers and decimals. Students at the high benchmark can apply their understanding and knowledge in a wide variety of relatively complex situations to solve problems involving fractions, decimals, negative integers, proportions, area, volume, and probability. Students at the advanced benchmark can organize information, make generalizations, solve nonroutine problems, and draw and justify conclusions from data. For example, they can compute percent change, solve simultaneous linear equations, and model simple situations algebraically.\\nIn TIMSS 2007 at fourth grade, countries were required to sample students in the grade that corresponded to the end of 4 years of formal schooling (the end of primary school), providing that the mean age at the time of testing was at least 9.5 years.

At the fourth-grade level in science, students at the low benchmark have some elementary knowledge of the Earth, life, and physical sciences, such as simple facts about magnets, electricity, and boiling. At the intermediate benchmark, students can apply basic knowledge and understanding to practical situations in the sciences, such as knowing some basic information about Earth\\'s features and processes, human biology, and health. At the high benchmark, students can apply knowledge and understanding to explain everyday phenomena, such as demonstrating some knowledge of life processes, physical states, and chemical changes. Students at the advanced benchmark can apply knowledge and understanding in beginning scientific inquiry, such as classifying organisms according to major physical and behavioral features. At the eighth-grade level in science, students at the low benchmark recognize some basic facts from the life and physical sciences, including some knowledge about the human body and familiarity with some everyday physical phenomena. Students at the intermediate benchmark can recognize and communicate basic scientific knowledge across a range of topics, including the solar system, human health, and energy. Students at the high benchmark demonstrate conceptual understanding of some science cycles, systems, and principles. For example, they show some understanding of the structure and function of organisms, physical and chemical changes, and major environmental issues. At the advanced benchmark, students demonstrate a grasp of some complex and abstract science concepts. For example, they can apply understanding of the complexity of living organisms and how they relate to their environment.\\nIn TIMSS 2007 at fourth grade, countries were required to sample students in the grade that corresponded to the end of 4 years of formal schooling (the end of primary school), providing that the mean age at the time of testing was at least 9.5 years.

That is, to avoid sample size losses resulting from sampled schools not participating, a mechanism was instituted to identify, a priori, substitute schools that have similar characteristics to the sampled schools that they may replace. For England, this applies to eighth-grade only. Average scores of 15-year-old students on the combined science literacy scale ranged from 475 in Italy to 534 in Canada, with the United States at 489 (figure 10). The U.S. average score was lower than the average score of 500 for the participating Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries (Baldi et al. 2007). Among the G-8 countries, the U.S. average score was lower than the average scores of the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, and Canada; higher than the average score of Italy; and not measurably different from the average scores of the russian Federation and France. U.S. 15-year-olds scored lower, on average, than their peers in the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, and Canada on the three science literacy subscales. The U.S. average score of 492 on the identifying scientific issues subscale was lower than the average scores of Germany (510), the United Kingdom (514), Japan 522, and Canada (532) (figure 10). However, students in the United States outperformed their peers in Italy (474) and the russian Federation (463) on this subscale. Among the G-8 countries, students in Canada had the highest score on the identifying scientific issues subscale. On the explaining phenomena scientifically subscale, 15-year-olds in Canada scored higher, on average, than their peers in all other G-8 countries except for Japan (there was no measurable difference between Canada and Japan on this subscale). U.S. students had an average score of 486 and were outperformed by students in the United Kingdom (517), Germany (519), Japan 527, and Canada (531). Unlike the identifying scientific issues subscale, U.S. students did not perform better, on average, than their peers in any other G-8 country on this subscale. On the using scientific evidence subscale, students in Japan and Canada scored higher, on average, than their peers in all other G-8 countries. U.S. students had an average score of 489 and were outperformed, on average, by students in France (511), the United Kingdom (514), Germany (515), Canada (542), and Japan (544). However, students in the United States outperformed their peers in Italy (467) on this subscale.\\nIn PISA, \"15-year-olds\" refers to students between 15 years and 3 months to 16 years and 2 months old at the time of the assessment and who have completed at least 6 years of formal schooling. PISA defines scientific literacy as \"an individual\\'s scientific knowledge and use of that knowledge to identify questions, to acquire new knowledge, to explain scientific phenomena, and to draw evidencebased conclusions about science-related issues, understanding of the characteristic features of science as a form of human knowledge and inquiry, awareness of how science and technology shape our material, intellectual, and cultural environments, and willingness to engage in science-related issues, and with the ideas of science, as a reflective citizen\" (OECD 2006, p. 12). In PISA 2006, students were assessed on their scientific literacy in relation to scientific knowledge or concepts, scientific processes, and situations or contexts, which were reflected in three subscales (identifying scientific issues, explaining phenomena scientifically, and using scientific evidence). The identifying scientific issues subscale includes recognizing issues that are possible to investigate scientifically; identifying keywords to search for scientific information; and recognizing the key features of a scientific investigation. The explaining phenomena scientifically subscale includes applying knowledge of science in a given situation; describing or interpreting phenomena scientifically and predicting changes; and identifying appropriate descriptions, explanations, and predictions. The using scientific evidence subscale includes interpreting scientific evidence and making and communicating conclusions; identifying the assumptions, evidence, and reasoning behind conclusions; and reflecting on the societal implications of science and technological developments. Scores on the PISA 2006 combined science literacy scale are reported on a scale from 0 to 1,000 with the OECD average fixed at 500 and the standard deviation fixed at 100.\\nIn PISA, \"15-year-olds\" refers to students between 15 years and 3 months to 16 years and 2 months old at the time of the assessment and who have completed at least 6 years of formal schooling.

Scores on the PISA 2006 combined science literacy scale are reported on a scale from 0 to 1,000 with the OECD average fixed at 500 and the standard deviation fixed at 100. Science proficiency was defined in terms of six levels (levels 1 through 6) based on student performance scores on the combined science literacy scale. Exact cut point scores are as follows: level 6 (a score greater than 707.93); level 5 (a score greater than 633.33 and less than or equal to 707.93); level 4 (a score greater than 558.73 and less than or equal to 633.33); level 3 (a score greater than 484.14 and less than or equal to 558.73); level 2 (a score greater than 409.54 and less than or equal to 484.14); and level 1 (a score greater than 334.94 and less than or equal to 409.54). Students who perform below level 1 (a score less than or equal to 334.94) \"…are unable to demonstrate science competencies in situations required by the easiest PISA tasks… such a low level of science competency can be regarded as putting them at a serious disadvantage for full participation in society and the economy\" (OECD 2007a, p. 42). In order to reach a particular proficiency level, a student must have been able to correctly answer a majority of items at that level. Students at each succeeding level are capable of solving science problems of increasing complexity. Students proficient at level 1 have such a limited scientific knowledge that it can only be applied to a few, familiar situations. They can present scientific explanations that are obvious and that follow explicitly from given evidence. Students at level 2 have adequate scientific knowledge to provide possible explanations or draw conclusions based on simple investigations; they are capable of direct reasoning and making literal interpretations of the results of scientific inquiry or technological problem solving. At level 3, students can identify clearly described scientific issues in a range of contexts; they can directly apply simple models or inquiry strategies to explain phenomena, interpret and use scientific concepts, and can make decisions based on scientific knowledge. At level 4, students can work effectively with situations that may involve explicit phenomena requiring them to make inferences about the role of science; they can select, integrate, and link explanations from different disciplines of science to real-world situations; they can reflect on their actions and can communicate decisions using scientific evidence. Students at level 5 can identify the scientific components of many complex real-world situations and can apply scientific concepts to these situations and evaluate scientific evidence; they can use well-developed inquiry abilities, bring critical insights to situations, and construct explanations based on evidence and arguments based on their critical analysis. Students proficient at level 6 clearly and consistently demonstrate advanced scientific thinking and reasoning, demonstrate willingness to use their scientific understanding in support of solutions to unfamiliar situations, and can develop real-world arguments based on scientific knowledge. For more information about how proficiency levels were set for PISA 2006, see the technical appendix in Baldi et al. (2007 \\nIn PISA, \"15-year-olds\" refers to students between 15 years and 3 months to 16 years and 2 months old at the at the time of the assessment and who have completed at least 6 years of formal schooling.

For more information about science literacy in PISA 2006, see the Definitions and Methodology section of indicators 10 and 11. Parent occupational status is measured by the Highest International Socioeconomic Index of Occupational Status (HISEI), which corresponds to the highest occupational index score of the student\\'s father or mother. Parental occupation, as reported by the student, was coded based on the current version of the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO-88) (International Labor Organization 1988). Occupational codes were, in turn, mapped onto an internationally comparable index of occupational status, the International Socioeconomic Index of Occupational Status (ISEI), developed by Ganzeboom, De Graaf, and Treiman (1992). The ISEI captures the attributes of occupations that convert parents\\' education into income. It is derived by optimally scaling occupation groups to maximize the indirect effect of education on income through occupation and to minimize the direct effect of education on income, net of occupation (both effects being net of age). As discussed in this indicator, students were also classified into national quarters on the ISEI. , which corresponds to the highest occupational index score of the student\\'s father or mother. This information, derived from students\\' responses to questionnaire items pertaining to parental occupation, is transformed into an index developed by Ganzeboom, De Graaf, and Treiman (1992 (PISA 2006), this indicator compares 15-year-old students\\' science achievement by immigration status across the G-8 countries. In PISA 2006, the student background questionnaire asked 15-year-olds to report if they were native (born in the country of assessment with at least one of their parents born in the same country), or had an immigrant background within two generations. Students not reporting native also reported if they were second generation (born in the country of assessment but with parents born in another country), or first generation (born in another country and with parents born in another country). 16 In 2006, 15 percent of U.S. 15-year-olds had an immigrant background within two generations; of these, 9 percent reported being second generation students and 6 percent reported being first generation students (figure 13a). The U.S. percentage of students with an immigrant background within two generations (15 percent) was higher than the corresponding percentage for the russian Federation (9 percent), the United Kingdom (9 percent), Italy (4 percent), and Japan (0.4 percent), but lower than that for Canada (21 percent).\\nIn PISA, \"15-year-olds\" refers to students between 15 years and 3 months to 16 years and 2 months old at the at the time of the assessment and who have completed at least 6 years of formal schooling. Students were tested in the language of instruction used in their school. Multilingual countries developed as many versions of the test instruments as there were languages of instruction used in the schools included in their national sample. PISA was designed to be as inclusive as possible. Each participating country attempted to maximize the coverage of 15-year-olds enrolled in education in its national sample so that results would be representative of the entire national school system. Thus, efforts were made to ensure that exclusions at the school or student level, if they were necessary, were minimized according to the PISA technical standards. Countries might find it necessary to reduce their coverage of the target population by excluding, for example, a small, remote geographical region due to inaccessibility. Instances where minority languages were used in only a very limited number of schools could be excluded from the target population if this was determined not to affect the overall quality of the data collection. Within schools, students could be excluded for being intellectually disabled, functionally disabled, or having insufficient language experience. Students were not to be excluded solely because of poor academic performance or normal discipline problems. With respect to insufficient language experience, students could be excluded only if they met the following three criteria: not being native speakers in the assessment language, having limited proficiency in the assessment language, and receiving less than 1 year of instruction in the assessment language. The sampling standards used in PISA permitted countries to exclude up to a total of 5 percent of the relevant population for approved reasons. All G-8 countries achieved this standard except for Canada, which had an overall exclusion rate of 6 percent. Canada\\'s withinschool exclusion rate was 5 percent. In all other G-8 countries, the within-school exclusion rates ranged from 0 percent in Japan to 4 percent in the United States. (See OECD 2009 for additional details about exclusions, including procedures, criteria, and rates.) Scores on the PISA 2006 combined science literacy scale are reported on a scale from 0 to 1,000 with the OECD average fixed at 500 and the standard deviation fixed at 100. For more information about science literacy in PISA 2006, see the Definitions and Methodology section of indicators 10 and 11. The computations presented in the text were carried out using unrounded numbers; therefore, they may differ from computations made using the rounded numbers that appear in figures 13a and 13b.

Using data from the 2006 Progress in International reading Literacy Study (PIrLS 2006), this indicator presents the reports of teachers of fourth-graders about how much time in a typical week they spend on reading instruction. As reported in this indicator, the average number of hours spent on reading instruction is grouped into three categories: 3 hours or less, more than 3 and up to and including 6 hours, and more than 6 hours. Teachers\\' reports of the average number of hours spent on reading instruction each week generally varied widely both across and within the participating G-8 countries 18 (figure 14). For example, in 2006, the percentage of fourth-graders whose teachers reported spending 3 hours or less in a typical week on reading instruction ranged from 10 percent in the United States to 71 percent in Germany. This category was reported more frequently than the other two categories in three G-8 countries, including Germany (71 percent), England (67 percent), and Italy (51 percent). For the category of more than 3 and up to and including 6 hours of reading instruction, the percentages ranged from 22 percent in the United States to 60 percent in the russian Federation. This category was reported more frequently than the other two categories in two G-8 countries, including the russian Federation (60 percent) and France (48 percent). For the category of more than 6 hours of reading instruction, the percentages ranged from 6 percent in Germany to 68 percent in the United States. The United States not only had the highest percentage of fourth-graders with teachers who reported spending more than 6 hours on reading instruction in a typical week, but it also was the only participating G-8 country to cite this category more frequently than any other category. Data for this indicator are from the PIrLS 2006 fourth-grade teacher questionnaire, which was administered to the teachers of the students sampled for PIrLS. The questionnaire included questions on teachers\\' background and on their teaching practices in the sampled students\\' classes. One or two classes were randomly sampled in each school, and teachers were asked to complete a questionnaire for each class they taught that contained sampled students. Thus, if a teacher taught two classes with sampled students, he or she was expected to complete a questionnaire for each of these classes. It should be noted that the PIrLS 2006 fourth-grade teachers do not constitute representative samples of teachers. rather, they are the teachers for nationally representative samples of fourth-grade students. Thus, the teacher data presented in this indicator were analyzed at the student level. In PIrLS 2006, countries were required to sample students in the grade that corresponded to the end of 4 years of formal schooling, France,Germany,Italy,Russian Federation,Scotland,United States providing that the mean age at the time of testing was at least 9.5 years. As defined by PIrLS, the 1st year of formal schooling begins with the 1st year of primary school (ISCED97 level 1), which should mark the beginning of formal instruction in reading, writing, and mathematics. Note that kindergarten is not counted. For most countries, the target grade was fourth grade, or its national equivalent.\\nTeachers\\' reports of how much time in a typical week is spent on reading instruction are based on the following question: \"regardless of whether or not you have formally scheduled time for reading instruction, in a typical week about how much time do you spend on reading instruction and/or activities with the students? Include things you do across curriculum areas and during formally scheduled time for reading instruction.\" Teachers were asked to write in the hours and minutes per week.  PIrLS 2006), this indicator presents teachers\\' reports about the strategies that they used to help fourth-graders having difficulty reading. Teachers were given a list of strategies and asked whether each one was used if a student begins to fall behind in reading. In 2006, a combination of strategies was reportedly used to varying degrees in the participating G-8 countries 19 to assist students having difficulty reading. One of the most common strategies was to ask parents to help their child with reading (table 4). The percentage of fourth-graders whose teachers reported asking parents to help their child with reading ranged from 84 percent in France to 99 percent in the russian Federation and England. In the United States, this strategy was used more frequently than any of the others; 97 percent of fourth-graders had a teacher who reported using it. A second strategy commonly used to assist students having difficulty reading was working with students individually. The percentage of fourth-graders whose teachers reported working with students individually ranged from 78 percent in England to 92 percent in Scotland and Italy. In the United States, 89 percent of fourth-graders had a teacher who reported doing this. In Italy, Scotland, and France, working with students individually was done about as frequently as asking the parents to help their child with reading. A third strategy commonly used by several G-8 countries to assist students having difficulty reading was to have the student work with other students; its reported use ranged from 45 percent in Scotland to 83 percent in Italy. In the United States 80 percent of fourth-graders had a teacher who reported using this strategy. There were a few strategies for assisting students having difficulty reading where reported use varied considerably across the G-8 countries. For example, the percentage of fourth-graders who had a teacher who reported assigning homework to help the student catch up ranged from 23 percent in France to 94 percent in the russian Federation, with the United States at 45 percent. The reported use of the strategy of having the student work in the regular classroom with a teacher aide ranged from 8 percent in Germany to 72 percent in England, with the United States at 31 percent. The reported use of the strategy of waiting to see if performance improves with maturation ranged from 17 percent in Scotland to 65 percent in the russian Federation, with the United States at 32 percent. A reading specialist may also be used to assist students having difficulty reading. In most of the G-8 countries, this was more likely to take place in a remedial classroom than in the regular classroom. For example, in England, the United States, and Scotland, about half of fourth-graders had a teacher who reported having students work in a remedial classroom with a reading specialist, which compares to 28, 15, and 18 percent, respectively, for having students work in the regular classroom with a reading specialist. PIrLS also asked teachers of fourth-graders about their access to remedial reading specialists. Thirty-four percent of fourth-graders in the United States and 24 percent of fourth-graders in England had teachers who reported always having a remedial reading specialist available (figure 15). Less than 10 percent of fourth-graders in France, Germany, and Italy had teachers who reported always having a remedial reading specialist available. England had the lowest percentage of fourth-graders whose teachers never had access to a remedial reading specialist (16 percent), while Italy had the highest (95 percent). In the United States, 29 percent of fourth-graders had teachers who reported never having access to a remedial reading specialist.\\nData for this indicator are from the PIrLS 2006 fourth-grade teacher questionnaire, which was administered to the teachers of the students sampled for PIrLS. The questionnaire included questions on teachers\\' background and on their teaching practices in the sampled students\\' classes. One or two classes were randomly sampled in each school, and teachers were asked to complete a questionnaire for each class they taught that contained sampled students. Thus, if a teacher taught two classes with sampled students, he or she was expected to complete a questionnaire for each of these classes. It should be noted that the PIrLS 2006 fourth-grade teachers do not constitute representative samples of teachers. rather, they are the teachers for nationally representative samples of fourth-grade students. Thus, the teacher data presented in this indicator were analyzed at the student level. In PIrLS 2006, countries were required to sample students in the grade that corresponded to the end of 4 years of formal schooling, providing that the mean age at the time of testing was at least 9.5 years. As defined by PIrLS, the 1st year of formal schooling begins with the 1st year of primary school (ISCED97 level 1), which should mark the beginning of formal instruction in reading, writing, and mathematics. Note that kindergarten is not counted. For most countries, the target grade was fourth grade, or its national equivalent. Teachers\\' reports about whether or not they used various strategies to help fourth-graders who are having difficulty reading are based on the percentages of students whose teachers responded \"yes\" to a list of strategies that follow the question, \"What do you usually do if a student begins to fall behind in reading?\" Teachers\\' reports about the availability of remedial reading specialists to assist fourth-graders who are having difficulty reading were based on teachers\\' responses to the question, \"Are the following resources available to you to deal with students who have difficulty with reading?\" As shown in figure 15, results are based on the percentages of students whose teachers responded \"always,\" \"sometimes,\" or \"never\" to the availability of a remedial reading specialist either in the classroom or in a remedial reading classroom.  \\nData for this indicator are from the PIrLS fourth-grade teacher questionnaire, which was administered to the teachers of the students sampled for PIrLS in 2001 and 2006. The questionnaire included questions on teachers\\' background and on their teaching practices in the sampled students\\' classes. One or two classes were randomly sampled in each school, and teachers were asked to complete a questionnaire for each class they taught that contained sampled students. Thus, if a teacher taught two classes with sampled students, he or she was expected to complete a questionnaire for each of these classes. It should be noted that the PIrLS fourth-grade teachers do not constitute representative samples of teachers in 2001 and 2006. rather, they are the teachers for nationally representative samples of fourth-grade students. Thus, the teacher data presented in this indicator were analyzed at the student level. In PIrLS 2006, countries were required to sample students in the grade that corresponded to the end of 4 years of formal schooling, providing that the mean age at the time of testing was at least 9.5 years. As defined by PIrLS, the 1st year of formal schooling  begins with the 1st year of primary school (ISCED97 level 1), which should mark the beginning of formal instruction in reading, writing, and mathematics. Note that kindergarten is not counted. For most countries, the target grade was fourth grade, or its national equivalent. For teachers\\' reports of their age, teachers were given the following response options in the PIrLS teacher questionnaire: (1) under 25; (2) 25 to 29; (3) 30 to 39; (4) 40 to 49; (5) 50 to 59; or (6) 60 or more. For the purposes of this indicator, the bottom two categories were combined and the top two categories were combined. The categories of \"29 years or younger\" and \"50 years or older\" were used in this indicator in order to highlight the percentage of fourth-graders with beginning teachers and the percentage with teachers nearing retirement. As presented in the text or shown in figure 16a, differences from 2001 to 2006 were computed from unrounded numbers; therefore, they may differ from computations made using the rounded numbers cited in the text or shown in figure 16b.\\nIn this indicator, the term \"teaching hours\" refers to \"net teaching hours,\" which are calculated as follows: annual number of weeks of instruction multiplied by the minimum/maximum number of periods that a teacher is supposed to spend teaching a class or group multiplied by the length of a period in minutes and divided by 60. Periods of time formally allowed for breaks between lessons or group of lessons, and days when schools are closed for public holidays and festivities, are excluded. Working time refers to the normal working hours of a full-time teacher. According to the formal policy in a given country, working time can refer either to the time directly associated with teaching (and other curricular • activities for students such as administering assignments and tests, but excluding annual examinations); or the time directly associated with teaching as well as the time • devoted to other activities related to teaching (such as lesson preparation, counseling students, correcting assignments and tests, professional development, meetings with parents, staff meetings, and general school tasks). Working time does not include paid overtime. Working time required at school refers to the working time teachers are supposed to be at school, including teaching time and nonteaching time. Statutory working time refers to the normal working hours of a fulltime teacher and includes net teaching hours (i.e., the time directly associated with teaching) as well as nonteaching hours devoted to activities related to teaching, such as lesson preparation, counseling students, and correcting assignments and tests. Statutory working time may include nonteaching time not spent at school. Teaching staff include professional personnel directly involved in teaching students. The classification includes classroom teachers; special education teachers; and other teachers who work with a whole class of students in a classroom, in small groups in a resource room, or in one-to-one teaching situations inside or outside a regular classroom. Teaching staff also includes department chairpersons whose duties include some teaching, but excludes non-professional personnel who support teachers in providing instruction to students, such as teachers\\' aides and other paraprofessional personnel.\\nData for this indicator are from the TIMSS 2007 teacher questionnaire, which was designed to obtain information about the classroom contexts for the teaching and learning of mathematics and science and about the implemented curriculum in these subjects. For each participating school, one teacher questionnaire that addressed both mathematics and science was administered to the classroom teacher of the sampled fourth-grade class, and separate versions of the questionnaire were administered to the mathematics teacher and the science teacher of the sampled eighth-grade class. It should be noted that the TIMSS 2007 teachers do not constitute representative samples of teachers. rather, they are the teachers for nationally representative samples of fourth-grade and eighth-grade students. Thus, the teacher data presented in this indicator were analyzed at the student level. In TIMSS 2007 at fourth grade, countries were required to sample students in the grade that corresponded to the end of 4 years of formal schooling (the end of primary school), providing that the mean age at the time of testing was at least 9.5 years. At eighth grade, countries were required to sample students in the grade that corresponded to the end of 8 years of formal schooling (the end of lower secondary education), providing that the mean age at the time of testing was at least 13.5 years.\\nData for this indicator are from the TIMSS 2007 teacher questionnaire, which was designed to obtain information about the classroom contexts for the teaching and learning of mathematics and science and about the implemented curriculum in these subjects.

At all schools with participating 15-year-old students, a school questionnaire was administered to the principal. It should be noted that the PISA 2006 principals do not constitute representative samples of principals. rather, they are the principals for nationally representative samples of 15-year-old students. Thus, the school data presented in this indicator were analyzed at the student level. In PISA, \"15-year-olds\" refers to students between 15 years and 3 months to 16 years and 2 months old at the time of the assessment and who have completed at least 6 years of formal schooling. As stated in the school questionnaire, achievement data include aggregated school or grade-level test scores or grades, or graduation rates.  In 2007, about 39 percent of U.S. eighth-graders had principals who reported at least a weekly occurrence of intimidation or verbal abuse of other students, which is higher than in all other participating G-8 countries. Using eighth-grade data from the 2007 Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS 2007), this indicator presents school principals\\' reports of both the incidence of behaviors that threaten a safe and orderly environment and their perceptions of these behaviors as a \"serious\" problem. It should be noted that what constitutes a \"serious\" problem may differ from one country to another. A relatively low number of threatening behaviors may be perceived as a \"serious\" problem in one country, but not in another, because of cultural differences and other factors. Of the seven problem behaviors shown in figure 21a, classroom disturbance was the most frequently cited in the United States. Across the participating G-8 countries, 24 the percentage of eighthgraders whose principals reported at least a weekly occurrence of a classroom disturbance ranged from 8 percent in Japan to 60 percent in Scotland, with the United States at 55 percent. The U.S. percentage was higher than in the russian Federation and Japan but not measurably different from that in the other participating G-8 countries. The U.S. percentage for classroom disturbance in 2007 was lower than in 1999, when 69 percent of U.S. eighth-graders were in schools whose principals reported at least a weekly occurrence of a classroom disturbance (see indicator 14 in Sherman, Honegger, and McGivern 2003). In 2007, intimidation or verbal abuse of other students was cited second most frequently in the United States. The percentage of eighth-graders in schools whose principals reported at least a weekly occurrence of intimidation or verbal abuse of other students ranged from 1 percent in the russian Federation to 39 percent in the United States, with the U.S. percentage higher than in all other participating G-8 countries. In Japan, compared with other participating G-8 countries, relatively low percentages of eighth-graders had principals who reported problem behaviors occurring at least weekly, with a range from 1 percent for both cheating and theft to 8 percent for classroom disturbance. There were lower percentages of students in Japan than in England, Italy, Scotland, and the United States whose principals reported that classroom disturbances and intimidation or verbal abuse of other students occurred at least weekly. Figure 21b shown principals\\' perceptions of these behaviors as a \"serious\" problem. In the United States in 2007, intimidation or verbal abuse of other students was cited most frequently as a serious problem (26 percent), followed by classroom disturbance (17 percent). 25 The percentage of U.S. eighth-graders whose principals reported intimidation or verbal abuse of other students as a serious problem was about 10 percentage points higher in 2007 than in 1999 (see indicator 14 in Sherman, Honegger, and McGivern 2003). In 2007, the percentages of eighth-graders in Japan whose principals reported the problem behaviors as serious problems ranged from 24 percent for cheating to 39 percent for intimidation or verbal abuse of other students. No particular behavior was cited most frequently as a serious problem in Japan (i.e., no measurable differences at the high end of the range). In Italy, the percentages of eighth-graders whose principals reported the problem behaviors as serious problems ranged from 8 percent for cheating to 31 percent for classroom disturbance. Classroom disturbance was cited more frequently as a serious problem in Italy than all other behaviors except intimidation or verbal abuse of other students (there was no measurable difference in reports of these two behaviors as serious problems). In England, the russian Federation, and Scotland, the percentages of eighth-graders whose principals reported the problem behaviors as serious problems were no higher than 8 percent for all of the behaviors.\\nData for this indicator are from the TIMSS 2007 eighth-grade school questionnaire, which asked school principals of the eighth-graders tested to provide information about curricular and instructional arrangements, school resources, and school climate. It should be noted that the TIMSS 2007 school principals do not constitute representative samples of school principals. rather, they are the school principals for nationally representative samples of eighthgrade students. Thus, the school data presented in this indicator were analyzed at the student level. Countries were required to sample students in the grade that corresponded to the end of 8 years of formal schooling (the end of lower secondary education), providing that the mean age at the time of testing was at least 13.5 years. As the data for this indicator, school principals were asked the following questions on the eighth-grade school questionnaire: \"How often does each of the following problem behaviors occur among eighth-grade students in your school? If the behavior occurs, how severe a problem does it present?\" The behaviors specified in the question were as follows: arriving late at school; absenteeism (i.e., unjustified absences); skipping class hours/periods; violating dress code; classroom disturbance; cheating; profanity; vandalism; theft; intimidation or verbal abuse of other students; physical injury to other students; intimidation or verbal abuse of teachers or staff; and physical injury to teachers or staff. The results for seven of these problem behaviors are presented in this indicator. response options for frequency included \"never,\" \"rarely,\" \"monthly,\" \"weekly,\" and \"daily.\" For this analysis, the latter two categories were combined. response options for the severity of the problem included \"not a problem,\" \"minor problem,\" and \"serious problem.\" For the reports of a behavior as a serious problem, the denominator for the percentages is students at all schools, not just students at schools whose principals report the occurrence of the behavior at least weekly.  This indicator presents a cross-country comparison of the average annual salaries of full-time public school teachers with the minimum training necessary to be fully qualified at the beginning of their teaching careers. Comparisons are presented across two education levels: primary and upper secondary. The indicator also compares the ratio of these average starting salaries to the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita for each of the reporting countries. Of the G-8 countries reporting data in 2006, Germany reported the highest average starting salary of public school teachers at both the primary and upper secondary levels (primary: $40,300; upper secondary: $45,200) (figure 22). The United States paid the second highest average starting salary to public school teachers at both levels (primary: $34,900; upper secondary: $33,700). France reported the lowest average starting salary at both levels (primary: $23,300; upper secondary: $26,000). In most G-8 countries in 2006, public school teachers at the beginning of their careers earned less than the average GDP per capita in their respective countries (table  6). For example, in the United States, the GDP per capita was about $43,800, and the average starting salary of such teachers was about 80 percent of the U.S. GDP per capita. In Germany, however, public primary and upper secondary school teachers at the beginning of their careers earned 126 and 141 percent, respectively, of the German GDP per capita. Included: England, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Scotland, United States Definitions and Methodology Teacher salary data are from the 2007 OECD Indicators of National Education Systems (INES) Survey on Teachers and the Curriculum and refer to the school year 2005-06. Data for GDP per capita are for calendar year 2006. Dollar figures for teacher salaries and GDP per capita were converted to U.S. equivalent dollars using purchasing power parities (PPPs), which equalize the purchasing power of different currencies. PPP exchange rate data are from the 2005-06 OECD National Accounts Database (OECD 2008b). Using PPPs to convert all teacher salary data to US equivalent dollars allows for cost of living differences across countries to be taken into account.\\nPer student expenditure is based on public and private full-timeequivalent (FTE) enrollment figures for the 2004-05 school year and current expenditure and capital outlays from both public and private sources, where data are available. Data for GDP per capita are for calendar year 2005. Dollar figures for education expenditure and GDP per capita were converted to U.S. equivalent dollars using purchasing power parities (PPPs), which equalize the purchasing power of different currencies. Using PPPs to convert all education expenditure data to US equivalent dollars allows for cost of living differences across countries to be taken into account. Within-country consumer price indices are used to adjust the PPP indices to account for inflation because the fiscal year has a different starting date in different countries. The national averages shown here do not represent the withincountry variation that may exist in the annual education expenditure per student.

The summations presented in the text were carried out using unrounded numbers; therefore, they may differ from summations made using the rounded numbers that appear in figure 25.   In the United States and all other G-8 countries reporting data, higher employment rates were associated with higher levels of educational attainment. In all reporting countries except the United Kingdom, between 52 and 58 percent of adults ages 25 to 64 whose highest educational attainment was lower secondary education or below were employed in 2006 (figure 26a). This compares to a range from 73 to 76 percent for adults whose highest educational attainment was upper secondary education 27 and from 81 to 86 percent for adults who had completed academic higher education, excluding the United Kingdom. For example, among U.S. adults in 2006, about 58 percent of those whose highest educational attainment was lower secondary education or below were employed, compared with 73 percent of those whose highest educational attainment was upper secondary education and 83 percent of those who had completed academic higher education. The United Kingdom had higher employment rates than all other reporting G-8 countries at all three levels of educational attainment (66, 81, and 89 percent, respectively). The gaps in employment rates for 25-to 64-year-olds at the highest and lowest levels of educational attainment (i.e., the difference in the employment rates for academic higher education and lower secondary education or below), ranged from 23 percentage points in the United Kingdom and France to 31 percentage points in Germany (figure 26a). In the United States, the gap was 25 percentage points. Figure 26b shows employment rates separately for males and females. In all reporting G-8 countries, males who had completed lower secondary education or below, upper secondary education, or academic higher education had higher employment rates than did females with a comparable amount of education. For males whose highest educational attainment was lower secondary education or below, employment rates ranged from 65 percent (Germany) to 72 percent (the United Kingdom). For females, the corresponding range was 33 percent (Italy) to 61 percent (the United Kingdom). In the United States, 70 percent of males and 44 percent of females whose highest educational attainment was lower secondary education or below were employed in 2006. For males whose highest educational attainment was upper secondary education, employment rates ranged from 78 percent (Germany) to 87 percent (Japan). For females, the corresponding range was 60 percent (Japan) to 76 percent (United Kingdom). In the United States, 80 percent of males and 67 percent of females whose highest educational attainment was upper secondary education were employed in 2006. In all reporting G-8 countries, at least 85 percent of males who had completed academic higher education were employed in 2006. For females who had completed academic higher education, employment rates ranged from 68 percent (Japan) to 87 percent (United Kingdom). In the United States, 88 percent of males and 78 percent of females who had completed academic higher education were employed in 2006. In most of the reporting G-8 countries, the gap in employment rates between males and females was largest among adults whose highest educational attainment was lower secondary education or below and smallest among adults who had completed academic higher education. In all reporting G-8 countries except Japan, the male-female gap for lower secondary education or below was approximately two to four times the size of the gap for academic higher education. Italy had the largest male-female gap at the level of lower secondary education or below (38 percentage points). In Japan, the male-female gap was 28 percentage points among adults who had completed upper secondary education and 27 percentage points among adults who had completed academic higher education; these gaps were larger than those in all other reporting G-8 countries at these levels. In the United States, the male-female gap was 27, 13, and 10 percentage points among adults who had completed lower secondary education or below, upper secondary education, and academic higher education, respectively.\\nThe employment rate of adults at a particular level of educational attainment is calculated as the number of individuals ages 25 to 64 with the particular level of educational attainment who are in employment divided by the number of individuals ages 25 to 64 with the same level of educational attainment. As shown in the figures, education levels are defined according to the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED97). For more information on the ISCED97 levels, see appendix A. Individuals whose highest level of education is academic higher education have completed at least a first university degree program, which prepares students for advanced research and highly qualified professions. First university degree programs vary in duration in different countries in different programs of study. In the United States, the first university degree corresponds to a bachelor\\'s degree; it excludes associate\\'s degrees. Percentage-point differences presented in the text were computed from unrounded numbers; therefore, they may differ from computations made using the rounded whole numbers that appear in the figures.\\nIncome refers to pretax income. As shown in the table and figure, education levels are defined according to the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED97).

For England, this applies to eighth-grade only.   with males scoring an average of 514 compared with 499 among females (figures 7a and 7b). In Germany, the difference by sex was 12 points (531 for males vs. 519 for females); in Scotland, the difference by sex was 9 points (499 for males vs. 490 for females); and in the United States, the difference by sex was 6 points (532 for males vs. 526 for females). In the russian Federation, however, females outperformed males by 7 points (540 for males vs. 548 for females). In England and Japan, no measurable differences were detected between the average scale scores of fourth-grade males and females.

On the TIMSS 2007 fourth-grade science assessment, average scale scores ranged from 500 in Scotland to 548 in Japan (Gonzales et al. 2008). Fourth-graders in Japan scored higher, on average, than their peers in Scotland, Germany, Italy, and the United States, but not measurably different from their peers in England and the russian Federation. The percentages of fourth-graders who reached the highest benchmark in science, advanced, ranged from 4 percent in Scotland to 16 percent in the russian Federation (figure 8). In the United States, 15 percent of fourth-graders reached the advanced benchmark, a higher percentage than in Germany and Scotland.

In the United States, 47 percent of fourth-graders reached the high benchmark, a larger percentage than in Germany and Scotland but smaller than in Japan. Eighty-six percent of fourth-graders in Japan were at or above the intermediate benchmark in science. This was higher than in all other participating G-8 countries, where the percentages ranged from 65 percent in Scotland to 82 percent in the russian Federation. In the United States, 78 percent of fourth-graders met the intermediate benchmark, a higher percentage than only Scotland. At eighth grade, students in Japan scored higher overall in science and generally had larger percentages of students reaching each of the four international benchmarks compared to their G-8 peers. A greater percentage of eighth-graders in England and Japan than in all other participating G-8 countries reached the advanced benchmark in science. Seventeen percent of eighth-graders in England and Japan reached the advanced benchmark, compared to a range from 4 percent in Italy to 11 percent in the russian Federation. In the United States, 10 percent of students reached the advanced benchmark, a higher percentage than in Scotland and Italy.

International comparisons of salaries provide simplified illustrations of the compensation received by teachers for their work. They provide a snapshot of the systems of compensation and the welfare inferences that can be made. Differences by country in taxation and social benefit systems as well as the use of financial incentives (including regional allowances for teaching in remote regions, family allowances, reduced rates on public transport, tax allowances on purchases of cultural goods, and other entitlements that contribute to a teacher's basic income) make it important to exercise caution in interpreting comparisons of teachers' salaries. Countries with centralized systems of education typically have national salary schedules. In countries like the United States, with decentralized education systems, local or regional governments establish their own salary schedules. The national averages shown here do not represent the within-country variation that exists in teacher salaries. The minimum training necessary to be fully qualified varies by country. In the United States, teacher training is decentralized and varies by state. As shown in the figure and table, education levels are defined according to the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED97).

Students who failed to answer correctly more than half of the items associated with level 1 were categorized as having proficiency below level 1.

The Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) measured the occupational status of the 15-year-old student's mother or father (whichever parent had the higher occupational status), with parental occupation reported by the student. Parental occupations were translated into index scores. A low index score (i.e., between 16 and 34 points) corresponds with a parental occupation requiring a minimal level of education (e.g., taxi driver, waiter/waitress), and a high index score (i.e., between 71 and 90 points) corresponds with a parental occupation requiring a high level of education (e.g., medical doctor, university professor). This indicator focuses on the relationship between parent occupational status and science achievement as measured in PISA 2006. results from PISA showed that U.S. students tended to come from homes with parents whose occupations required comparatively higher levels of education relative to their peers in other G-8 countries. In 2006, the United States and Canada had the highest mean occupational index scores of all the G-8 countries, which is similar to what was found in PISA in 2003. 15 In 2006, the range across the G-8 countries was from 46.4 in Italy to 53.5 in Canada, with the United States at 52.5 (OECD 2007b). Furthermore, when students were classified into national quarters on the occupational index, U.S. 15-year-olds in the bottom national quarter had a higher mean index score than their peers in Italy, France, Germany, and the russian Federation (29.9 in the United States compared to a range from 27.2 in Italy to 29.5 in the russian Federation). In Canada and Japan, students in the bottom national quarter had a higher mean index score (32.7 and 34.2, respectively) than their U.S. counterparts. These results showed that parent occupational status was generally higher for U.S. students compared to their G-8 peers. Among those students from families with low occupational status relative to other students in their country, U.S. students tended to have parents whose occupations required comparatively higher levels of education relative to their peers in other G-8 countries. On the other hand, when looking at the science achievement of those students from families with low occupational status, U.S. students did not perform higher than their counterparts in any G-8 country. U.S. students in the bottom national quarter of the occupational index were outperformed by students in the bottom national quarter of the index in the United Kingdom, Germany, Canada, and Japan on the PISA 2006 combined science literacy scale (445 in the United States compared to a range from 472 in the United Kingdom to 506 in Japan) (figure 12a). Nevertheless, within all G-8 countries, there was a relationship between parent occupational status and students' achievement scores. Specifically, students in the top national quarter of the occupational index scored higher on the combined science literacy scale than students in the bottom national quarter of the index. This difference ranged from 53 points in Japan to 111 points in France; in the United States, this difference was 97 points. Another way to evaluate the relationship between parent occupational status and science achievement is to examine the specific change in score on the combined science literacy scale in response to a one-standard-deviation increase (i.e., 17.1 units) in the occupational index score. A greater increase in a country's average achievement score per one-standard-deviation increase in the occupational index score implies a stronger relationship between parent occupational status and performance in that country. Across the G-8 countries, an increase of one standard deviation on the index was associated with an average performance increase that ranged from 19 score points in Japan to 42 score points in France (figure 12b). In the United States, an increase of one standard deviation on the index was associated with an average performance increase of 36 score points. Compared to the United States, four G-8 countries had a weaker relationship between the occupational index and science literacy performance-Japan, the russian Federation, Canada, and Italy-and the other G-8 countries were not measurably different from the United States in this regard.\"}, {'section_title': 'Indicator 12', 'text': 'In all G-8 countries with data shown 17 except the russian Federation, 15-year-old students with an immigrant background scored lower, on average, on the PISA 2006 combined science literacy scale than their native peers (figure 13b).

Although teachers in the United States were contracted to teach more hours than their peers in the other reporting G-8 countries, they worked less total hours (teaching time plus related nonteaching time) than their peers in Japan and Germany. This indicator presents two measures of teachers' average working time per year: (1) teaching hours-the amount of time spent instructing students, and 2working time-the total amount of time spent teaching and doing other work-related activites (e.g., preparing lessons and correcting assignments and tests). It should be noted that these results are generally based on the amount of time that teachers are contracted to work and do not take into account the possible variation in the number of hours teachers actually work. In 2006, teachers in the United States at the primary, lower secondary, and upper secondary levels were contracted to teach an average of 1,080 hours during the school year (figure 17). This was more than in any other G-8 country reporting data at these three levels. Besides the United States, the only other reporting G-8 country with the same number of teaching hours at the three education levels was Scotland (893 hours). In France, Germany, and Italy, primary school teachers were contracted to work more teaching hours than lower and upper secondary teachers; of these three countries, France reported the greatest differential, with 276 more hours for primary school teachers than for lower secondary school teachers, and 294 more hours for primary school teachers than for upper secondary school teachers. The only reporting G-8 country in which primary school teachers spent fewer contracted hours teaching than lower and upper secondary teachers was the russian Federation, with 290 fewer hours for primary school teachers. regulations on working time vary across the G-8 countries (see table 5). England and the United States specify the number of hours that teachers are required to be at school. Germany, Japan and Scotland specify statutory working time, which can occur at school or elsewhere. Although teachers in the United States were contracted to teach more hours than their peers in the other reporting G-8 countries, they worked less total hours than their peers in Japan and Germany when working time was defined not only as time spent on teaching but also as time spent on other work-related activities.

Programs that prepare students for advanced research and highly qualified professions are called first university degree programs. First university degree programs vary in duration in different countries in different programs of study. In the United States, this corresponds to a bachelor's degree but excludes associate's degrees. This indicator compares the percentage of first degrees awarded in four major fields of study: social sciences, business, and law; science, mathematics, and engineering; the arts and humanities; and education. In 2006, a greater percentage of first university degrees were awarded in the field of social sciences, business, and law than in any other field in all G-8 countries (figure 25). The russian Federation awarded the highest percentage of first university degrees in this combined field (50 percent), which exceeded that awarded in the other major fields in total-arts and humanities; science, mathematics, and engineering; and education (41 percent). In the other G-8 countries, the percentage of first university degrees awarded in the combined field of social sciences, business, and law ranged from 28 percent in Germany to 42 percent in the United States. In science, mathematics, and engineering-related fields, the United States awarded among the lowest percentages of first university degrees of all the G-8 countries. Sixteen percent of first university degrees in the United States and 17 percent of first university degrees in Canada were awarded in science, mathematics, and engineering-related fields. In the other G-8 countries, the percentages ranged from 20 percent in Japan to 27 percent in Germany. The United States was the only G-8 country to award more first university degrees in the arts and humanities than in science, mathematics, and engineering. In 2006, about 19 percent of first university degrees were awarded to U.S. graduates in arts and humanities (compared to 16 percent in science, mathematics, and engineering). The russian Federation awarded the lowest percentage of first university degrees in the arts and humanities (4 percent); in the other G-8 countries, the percentages ranged from 15 percent in Canada and Italy to 22 percent in Germany. The smallest percentage of first university degrees was awarded in the field of education in all G-8 countries except the russian Federation. The russian Federation was the only G-8 country to award more first university degrees in education than in the arts and humanities (12 vs. 4 percent). Canada awarded the highest percentage of first university degrees in education (13 percent), while France and the United Kingdom awarded the lowest percentages in this field (both at 4 percent). The United States fell within this range, awarding 7 percent of first university degrees in education.\\nAcademic higher education 5 Upper secondary education 4 Lower secondary education or below 3 Lower secondary education or below 5 Academic higher education 3 Upper secondary education 4 Lower secondary education or below 5  2008).

The ISCED97 levels address the intent (e.g., to study basic subjects or prepare students for university) of each year of a particular education system, but do not indicate the depth or rigor of study in that year. Thus, the ISCED97 is useful when comparing the age range of students in upper secondary schools across nations; however, it does not indicate whether the curriculum and standards are equivalent within the same year of schooling across nations. The ISCED97 allows researchers to compile statistics on education internationally. The ISCED97 levels are as follows: ISCED97 level 0 is classified as preprimary education. This is • defined as the initial stage of organized instruction, designed primarily to introduce very young children to a school-type environment. ISCED97 level 0 programs can either be center or school based. Preschool and kindergarten programs in the United States fall into the level 0 category, although kindergarten is typically considered an elementary grade in the United States. ISCED97 level 1 consists of primary education, which usually • lasts 4 to 6 years. ISCED97 level 1 typically begins between ages 5 and 7, and is the stage where students begin to study basic subjects, such as reading, writing, and mathematics. There are differences within the education systems of some G-8 countries because responsibilities and oversight for education take place at the regional or local level. However, the charts and accompanying text in this appendix are intended to give the reader a general overview of the education system of each G-8 country, from the preprimary to the doctoral level. As indicated in the source note for each country chart, the information summarizing each country's education system comes largely from the previous Comparative Indicators report (2006). However, some modifications were made based on updated online resources and comments received from international reviewers. The reader is encouraged to seek out additional resources to gain a fuller and deeper understanding of each country's education system. A list of websites with additional information is provided at the end of this reader's Guide, and additional sources are cited after each country's education system is presented.\"}, {'section_title': 'How to read the charts', 'text': \"Each of the charts on the following pages is a broad representation of the education system of a G-8 country. The charts are not intended to show all possible pathways that a student can take or the many configurations of grades that may be found within the same school. rather, each chart is intended to provide a general description that is useful for comparison across the G-8 countries. The colors on each chart correspond to ISCED97 levels (see next section). The ISCED97 term for each level of education is written within each block. The terms in italics in each block are a country's designation for that particular level (e.g., high school for upper secondary school). The left side of each chart is labeled with the typical ages corresponding to each level of education. The age labels represent the typical age at which a student begins the corresponding year of schooling; often, students are 1 year older at the end of the school year. Ages in bold text are the ages at which enrollment is universal, defined here as an enrollment rate of more than 90 percent.

ISCED97 level 4 programs consist of postsecondary nontertiary • programs. Postsecondary nontertiary programs are primarily vocational and are taken after the completion of secondary school, though the content is not more advanced than the content of secondary school courses. Although not included in the charts, postsecondary nontertiary programs are described in the text. ISCED97 level 4 programs in the United States are often in the form of 1-year certificate programs. Tertiary programs • 29 are divided into ISCED97 levels 5A, 5B, and 6. ISCED97 level 5A refers to academic higher education below the doctoral level. Level 5A programs are intended to provide sufficient qualifications to gain entry into advanced research programs and professions with high skill requirements. The international classification includes programs of medium length that last less than 5 years and long programs that last 5 to 7 years. In the United States, bachelor's, master's, and first professional degree programs are classified as ISCED97 level 5A. ISCED97 level 5B refers to vocational higher education. Level 5B programs provide a higher level of career and technical education and are designed to prepare students for the labor market. In the international classification, these programs last 2 to 4 years. In the United States, associate's degree programs are classified at this level. ISCED97 level 6 refers to the doctoral level of academic higher education.

The General Certificate of Education (GCE) Advanced levels (A levels) and the GCE Advanced Subsidiary examinations (AS levels) are similar tests taken in the sixth form (described below). NOTE: After the first 2 years of upper secondary school, students take General Certificate of Secondary Education qualifications (GCSEs), typically at age 16. They then have the option of continuing school for 2 years, often called the sixth form. Some schools do not offer the sixth form, in which case students can transfer to a sixth form college (which is similar but in a separate school) or go to a further education college. Sixth forms usually offer General Certificate of Education Advanced Subsidiary qualifications (GCE AS levels) at age 17 and General Certificate of Education Advanced level examinations (GCE A levels) at age 18. GCE A levels are usually required for entry to higher education. An increasing range of GCSEs, A levels, and AS levels in applied (vocational) subjects is also being offered, along with a developing range of 14-19 Diplomas. Such 14-19 Diplomas involve part-time or fulltime programs that combine vocational and academic studies in broad subject areas. They are suitable for 16-to 19-year-old adult learners or upper secondary students. Students are increasingly able to enter higher education with these parallel GCSE, A level, AS level, and 14-19 Diploma vocational qualifications.

Comparative Indicators of Education in the United States and Other G-8 Countries: 2009 draws on the most current information about education from four primary sources: the Indicators of National Education Systems (INES) at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD); the Progress in International reading Literacy Study (PIrLS); the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA); and the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS). Begun in 2002, the series is published on a biennial basis. It should be noted that most of the indicators in this report do not contain data for the complete set of G-8 countries. This is the result of a G-8 country not reporting data or not participating in a study. Also, the United Kingdom participated as one country in PISA, but in PIrLS and TIMSS England and Scotland participated as individual systems. Similarly, Canada participated as separate provinces in PIrLS 2006. Indicators that use PIrLS and TIMSS as data sources report England and Scotland separately. Indicators that use PIrLS data present results for the participating Canadian provinces in appendix tables (see appendix B). Thus, in indicators using PIrLS data and discussed in the summary that follows, the \\\"participating\\\" G-8 countries include England, France, Germany, Italy, the russian Federation, Scotland, and the United States. In indicators using TIMSS data, \\\"participating\\\" G-8 countries include England, Germany, Italy, Japan, the russian Federation, Scotland, and the United States at fourth grade, and England, Italy, Japan, the russian Federation, Scotland, and the United States at eighth grade. 1 In indicators using INES data, the \\\"reporting\\\" G-8 countries vary somewhat; these are shown in each indicator and noted in the summary. The main findings of this report are summarized below. These highlights are organized around the five major sections of the report-population and school enrollment; academic performance; context for learning; expenditure for education; and education returns: educational attainment and income.\"\n",

In 2006, one of the most common strategies for assisting students having difficulty reading was to ask parents to help their child with reading. A second strategy commonly used was working with students individually.

Since the 1960s, the united States has participated actively in international projects that are designed to provide key information about the performance of the u.S. education system relative to education systems in other countries. these projects include the Indicators of national Education Systems (InES) at the organization for Economic cooperation and development (oEcd); the Progress in International reading Literacy Study (PIrLS); the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA); and the trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (tIMSS). this report, Comparative Indicators of Education in the United States and Other G-8 Countries: 2009, draws on the most current information available from most of these projects at the time the report was being produced (in the summer and fall of 2008) to present a set of education indicators that describes how the u.S. education system compares with education systems in other economically developed countries. updated information from these various projects will be incorporated in subsequent reports. Although the international education projects cited above involve many countries worldwide, the comparisons in this report focus on the Group of Eight (G-8) countries: canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the russian Federation, the united Kingdom, and the united States. these are among the most industrialized countries in the world. the G 8 countries were selected as a comparison group because of the similarities in their economic development and because the other G-8 countries are among the major economic partners of the united States. the leaders of these countries meet regularly to discuss economic and other policy issues. What 's New in 2009? this report is the fourth in a series of reports published by the national center for Education Statistics (ncES) that describes how the education system in the united States compares with education systems in the other G-8 countries. It is the first of these reports to include data from all three international assessments of students in which the united States regularly participates-PIrLS, PISA, and tIMSS. the indicators use 2006 data from PIrLS and PISA and 2007 data from tIMSS. Many of the indicators in this report are updates of previous indicators that used data from earlier cycles, such as tIMSS 1999 and PIrLS 2001. there are also a few new PIrLS indicators-one presenting data using the PIrLS international performance benchmarks, another reporting the amount of time spent on reading instruction at school, and another highlighting trends in teacher preparation and experience. the PISA indicators, in particular, offer a unique contribution to the series of Comparative Indicators reports. PISA is a system of international assessments that measures 15-year-old students' performance in reading literacy, mathematics literacy, and science literacy every 3 years. Although all three of these subject areas are assessed in each PISA data collection effort, one is assessed in depth (i.e., is considered the major subject area) on a rotating basis. the major subject area in 2000 (when PISA was initiated) was reading literacy; in 2003, it was mathematics literacy. thus, prior Comparative Indicators reports have focused on 15-year-old students' reading and mathematics performance. the current report features indicators pertaining to students' science performance, as assessed in the most recent (2006) study. the 2008 edition of Education at a Glance, which presents international education data compiled by oEcd, was used largely to update several indicators that have been presented previously. However, this resource was also used to produce a new indicator in this report: teachers' working time.\"\n",

      "        \"text\": \"Many of the indicators in this report refer to at least one of the following education levels: preprimary education, primary education, secondary education, and higher education. A brief overview of the education levels is presented here to provide the reader with a frame of reference while reading the indicators (see appendix A for more detailed descriptions). to ensure comparability in the indicators across countries, each country restructured its national education data to correspond with the definitions of education levels that were developed in the 1997 revision of the International Standard classification of Education (IScEd97) (united nations Educational, Scientific and cultural organization [unESco] 1997). the following descriptions highlight the key features of (1) education programs from preprimary through secondary education and (2) higher education programs. Preprimary education includes programs of education for children at least 3 years of age that involve organized, center-based instructional activities; in most countries, preprimary education is not compulsory. Primary education includes programs that are designed to give students a sound basic education in reading, writing, and mathematics, along with an elementary understanding of other subjects, such as history, geography, science, art, and music. In the international classification, primary education usually begins at the start of compulsory education (around age 6) and lasts for 6 years. Secondary education encompasses two stages: lower secondary education and upper secondary education. Lower secondary education includes programs that are designed to complete basic education; the standard duration in the international classification is 3 years. Upper secondary education is designed to provide students with more in-depth knowledge of academic or vocational subjects and to prepare them for higher level academic or vocational studies or entry into the labor market. The standard duration of upper secondary education in the international classification is 3 years. Higher education includes tertiary programs 1 that fall into three main categories: Academic higher education below the doctoral level. \\u2022 These largely theory-based programs are intended to provide sufficient qualifications to gain entry into advanced research programs and professions with high skill requirements. To be classified as such, a degree program must last at least 3 years and is typically preceded by at least 13 years of formal schooling. In the United States, bachelor's, master's, and first professional degree programs are classified at this level. Vocational higher education. \\u2022 These programs provide a higher level of career and technical education and are designed to prepare students for the labor market. In the international classification, these programs last 2 to 4 years. In the United States, associate's degree programs are classified at this level. Doctoral level of academic higher education. \\u2022 These programs usually require the completion of a research thesis or dissertation. The international classification also includes an education level that straddles the boundary between upper secondary and higher education: postsecondary nontertiary education. These programs of study-which are primarily vocational in nature-are generally taken after the completion of upper secondary education. They are often not significantly more advanced than upper secondary programs, but they serve to broaden the knowledge of participants who have already completed upper secondary education. In the United States, these programs are often in the form of occupationally specific vocational certificate programs, such as 1-year certification programs offered at technical institutes or community colleges. 2 Mapping G-8 Countries' Education Systems to the ISCED97 Matching the education levels of individual countries to the ISCED97 classification can be challenging, because the particulars of individual countries seldom fit ISCED97 perfectly. Using ISCED97 classifications as a starting point, NCES worked with education professionals in other G-8 countries to create a general overview of each country's education system. As an aid to the reader, schematics of how the ISCED97 applies to each of the G-8 countries are provided in appendix A, accompanied by text describing each system in greater detail.\"\n",

The section concludes with an indicator that examines the extent to which foreign students are enrolled in higher education across the G-8 countries. The next section, academic performance, has indicators grouped by subject area into three subsections: reading, mathematics, and science. The indicators present findings on student performance in the G-8 countries, including achievement differences across key demographic variables such as sex, parent occupational status, and immigrant status. The third section highlights a range of key policy-relevant issues pertaining to the context for learning across the G-8 countries. For example, using data as reported by school teachers, there are indicators pertaining to the amount of time devoted to reading instruction, strategies used to assist students who have fallen behind in reading, trends in teacher preparation and experience, teachers' working time, and teacher professional development in mathematics and science. This section also presents the reports of school principals on the uses of summative achievement data and the frequency of student behavior problems. The fourth section provides a comparative look at expenditure for education, including breakdowns by expenditure as a percentage of a country's gross domestic product (GDP) and an indicator on public school teacher salaries in primary and secondary education. The final section, education returns: educational attainment and income, focuses on educational attainment, employment rates, and earnings (including breakdowns by sex and field of study). Each indicator is presented in a two-page format. The first page presents key findings that highlight how the United States compares with its G-8 peers (with data available) on the issue examined in the indicator. The key findings are followed by a section that defines the terms used in the indicator and describes key features of the methodology used to produce it. The second page presents graphical depictions of the data that support the key findings.

For example, Japan did not participate in PIrLS 2006, France did not participate in TIMSS 2007, and Germany did not participate in TIMSS 2007 at the eighth grade; therefore, these countries do not appear in indicators using these data. Two other countries that warrant special mention include Canada and the United Kingdom. Canada participated as a unified country in PISA 2006, and in this report, data for Canada are shown and discussed in the PISA indicators. However, in PIrLS 2006, Canada participated as separate provinces. In this report, results for the Canadian provinces are not reported in the PIrLS indicators; rather, they can be found in the appendix tables (see appendix B). In TIMSS 2007, some Canadian provinces took part in the study as benchmarking participants. These findings do not appear in this report, but they can be found in the international reports published by IEA (Mullis, Martin, and Foy 2008;Martin, Mullis, and Foy 2008). The United Kingdom, which includes England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales, participated in PISA 2006.

The population of 5-to 29-year-olds represented 34 percent of the total population in the United States (table 2). In the other G-8 countries, the corresponding percentages ranged from 25 percent in Italy to 33 percent in the russian Federation. From 1998 to 2008, the United States had the largest net percentage gain in population size of 5-to 29-year-olds (6 percent) among the G-8 countries (figure 1). The population of 5-to 29-year-olds declined in every other G-8 country except for Canada, with decreases from 1998 to 2008 ranging from 1 percent in the United Kingdom to 18 percent in Japan. In Canada, growth of this population was essentially flat (0.4 percent). The subpopulation of 5-to 19-year-olds (which generally includes individuals of primary-and secondary-school age) represented 20 percent of the total population in the United States in 2008 (table 2).

The United States was the only G-8 country to experience a net percentage gain in subpopulation size of 5-to 19-year-olds from 1998 to 2008 (3 percent) (figure 1). The population of 5-to 19-year-olds declined in all other G-8 countries, with decreases from 1998 to 2008 ranging from 1 percent in France to 32 percent in the russian Federation. The subpopulation of 20-to 29-year-olds (which generally includes individuals of postsecondary education age) represented 14 percent of the total population in the United States in 2008, below the percentage in the russian Federation (17 percent) (table 2). The percentages in the other G-8 countries were slightly lower than in the United States, ranging from 11 percent in Italy to 13 percent in Canada, the United Kingdom, and France. The russian Federation had the largest net percentage gain in subpopulation size of 20-to 29-year-olds, an increase of 14 percent from 1998 to 2008 (figure 1). The United States had the second largest net percentage gain in subpopulation size (11 percent). Among the other G-8 countries, Canada and the United Kingdom experienced a net percentage gain from 1998 to 2008 (7 and 1 percent, respectively), while the other G-8 countries experienced declines over this period, ranging from 5 percent in France to 28 percent in Italy.\"\n",

      "        \"text\": \"In each country, the percentage of the population of 5-to 29-yearolds in 1998 and 2008 is calculated by dividing the population of 5-to 29-year-olds by the total population. The percentage change in the population of 5-to 29-year-olds is calculated by subtracting the population of 5-to 29-year-olds in 1998 from this population in 2008 and dividing by the 1998 population of 5-to 29-year-olds. These calculations are applied in the same way to the age groups 5 to 19 and 20 to 29. The age group (e.g., 5 to 29) as a percentage of the total population may have declined from 1998 to 2008 even though the size of the age group may have increased. This is because of a higher rate of increase of the total population compared to the rate of increase for the specific population age group.      In 2006, all or almost all 3-and 4-year-old children were enrolled in preprimary or primary education programs in France and Italy (table 3). In Germany, the United Kingdom, and Japan, at least 80 percent of 3-and 4-year-olds were enrolled in preprimary or primary education programs; in the United States, 48 percent were enrolled. Beginning at age 6 in the United States and at age 7 in the russian Federation, at least 90 percent of the population was enrolled in formal education (figure 2). In 2006, the United States and most other reporting G-8 countries had nearly universal school participation of children ages 5-14-the age range that typically corresponds with primary and lower secondary education (table 3). In the russian Federation, 82 percent of 5-to 14-year-olds were enrolled in formal education programs; all other G-8 countries were at 98 percent participation or higher. The United States had an enrollment rate of 78 percent in 2006 for youth ages 15-19-the age range that corresponds most closely with upper secondary education. The U.S. rate was lower than the rates in Italy (81 percent), France (86 percent), and Germany (89 percent), but higher than the rates in the russian Federation (74 percent) and the United Kingdom (70 percent). Compulsory education ends at age 18 in Germany, age 17 in the United States, age 16 in France and the United Kingdom, and age 15 in Italy, Japan, and the russian Federation (figure 2). 5 While participation rates were at 90 percent or higher through the end of compulsory education in Italy, the russian Federation, France, and Japan, they fell below this level in Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Enrollment rates for 20-to 29-year olds-the age range that corresponds most closely to the typical age of enrollment in higher education-were less than 30 percent among the six G-8 countries reporting data (table 3). The United States had an enrollment rate of 23 percent for this age range. The U.S. rate was lower than the rate in Germany (28 percent), but higher than the rates in Italy and France (both at 20 percent), the russian Federation (19 percent), and the United Kingdom (17 percent).\\nThe percentage of the population at given ages enrolled in education is called an \\\"enrollment rate.\\\" In this indicator, the term \\\"enrollment rate\\\" refers to the \\\"net enrollment rate\\\" and is defined as the number of students in a particular age group enrolled in education divided by the population of that same age group. The reference year is 2006 for population and enrollment data in all countries except the russian Federation, which has a reference year of 2005. Enrollment rates may exceed 100 percent for some countries and some age categories largely because of different reference dates for school enrollment and population data. Enrollments include all full-time and part-time students in public and private institutions. Enrollment in preprimary education programs (generally the 3-to 4-year-old age group) includes only children in preschool, nursery, or center-based daycare programs and excludes children in daycare operated in homes. The ending age of compulsory education is the age at which individuals are no longer legally required to participate in formal education. 2   Table 3.

NOTE: Reference year is 2006 for population and enrollment data in all countries except the Russian Federation, as noted above; however, reference dates may differ within that year. Thus, percentages shown in the table are approximations. As described in the source cited below, enrollment rates for some countries were reported as slightly exceeding 100 percent in one or more age ranges (e.g., see 5-to 14-year-olds) due to different reference dates for school enrollment and population data. Enrollment in formal education at the preprimary education level includes children in center-based programs and excludes children in home-based early childhood education.

This age varies across states, ranging from 16 to 18; the modal age is 16 (Digest of Education Statistics, 2007, Kingdom, Canada, Germany, and France. Over the past 3 decades, the number of foreign students (i.e., students enrolled outside their country of citizenship) in higher education has grown almost fivefold: from 0.6 million worldwide in 1975 to 2.9 million in 2006 (OECD 2008a). In 2006, G-8 countries (as countries of destination) hosted close to two-thirds of all foreign students in higher education (figure 3a). The United States received the largest percentage of these foreign students (20 percent), followed by the United Kingdom (11 percent), Germany (9 percent), and France (9 percent). Altogether, in 2006, these four G-8 countries accounted for almost one-half of all foreign students enrolled in higher education. The other G-8 countries each took in between 2 and 5 percent of all foreign students enrolled in higher education. In addition to the share of foreign students hosted by each G-8 country, another measure can be examined that takes into account the size of a country's higher education system: the percentage of a country's students enrolled in higher education who are foreign students. Among the G-8 countries, the United States had the largest number of foreign students enrolled in higher education (OECD 2008a). However, in comparison to the United States, foreign students made up a larger percentage of enrollments in higher education in the United Kingdom (18 percent), Canada (15 percent), Germany (11 percent), and France (11 percent) (figure 3b). In the United States, nonresidents made up 3 percent of the total enrollment in higher education. 6 In the russian Federation, foreign students made up 1 percent of the total enrollment in higher education, lower than in all other G-8 countries.\\nForeign students are defined as noncitizens enrolled in education programs in a host country, and thus some permanent residents are included. International students are defined as students who enrolled in institutions in other countries, and thus do not include permanent residents. As shown in the figures, education levels are defined according to the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED97).

As defined by PIrLS, the 1st year of formal schooling begins with the 1st year of primary school (ISCED97 level 1), which should mark the beginning of formal instruction in reading, writing, and mathematics. Note that kindergarten is not counted. For most countries, the target grade was fourth grade, or its national equivalent. PIrLS scores are reported on a scale from 0 to 1,000 with the scale average fixed at 500 and the standard deviation fixed at 100. Since the PIrLS reading achievement scales were designed to reliably measure student achievement over time, the metric of the scales was established originally with the 2001 assessment. In order to describe concretely the knowledge and skills attained along the performance scale, PIrLS 2006 established four international achievement benchmarks in reading literacy (low, intermediate, high, and advanced). These benchmarks are identical to the cutpoints used for the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS). Information about the rationale underlying the benchmarks and the procedures used to set the cutpoints is available in Martin, Mullis, and Kennedy (2007). Four points on the scales were identified for use as international benchmarks: 400 for the low benchmark, 475 for the intermediate benchmark, 550 for the high benchmark, and 625 for the advanced benchmark. These were selected to represent the range of performance shown by students internationally.  1 Met international guidelines for participation rates only after substitute schools were included. That is, to avoid sample size losses resulting from sampled schools not participating, a mechanism was instituted to identify, a priori, substitute schools that have similar characteristics to the sampled schools that they may replace. SOURCE: Mullis, I.V.S., Martin, M.O., Kennedy, A.M., and Foy, P. (2007) In 2006, average scores of fourth-grade females in reading literacy were higher than the average scores of fourth-grade males in all participating G-8 countries. Among countries with the largest score differences between males and females were Scotland (538 for females vs. 516 for males), with a difference of 22 points; England (549 for females vs. 530 for males), with a difference of 19 points; and the russian Federation (572 for females vs. 557 for males), with a difference of 15 points ( figure 5a and figure 5b). Among countries with the smallest differences related to sex were Germany (551 for females vs. 544 for males) and Italy (555 for females vs. 548 for males), both with a difference of 7 points. In the United States, females outperformed males by 10 points (545 for females vs. 535 for males).\\nIn PIrLS 2006, countries were required to sample students in the grade that corresponded to the end of 4 years of formal schooling, providing that the mean age at the time of testing was at least 9.5 years.

SOURCE: Mullis, I.V.S., Martin, M.O., Kennedy, A.M., and Foy, P. (2007) On the TIMSS 2007 fourth-grade mathematics assessment, students in Japan outperformed students in the other participating G-8 countries, with higher percentages of Japanese fourth-graders reaching each of the four international benchmarks. The highest international benchmark, advanced, was reached by 23 percent of Japan's fourth-graders in mathematics, compared with percentages ranging from 4 percent in Scotland to 16 percent in the russian Federation and England (figure 6). In the United States, 10 percent of fourth-graders reached the advanced benchmark. The percentage in the United States was higher than in Germany, Italy, and Scotland, but lower than in the russian Federation, England, and Japan. In Japan, 61 percent of fourth-graders reached the high benchmark in mathematics; the percentages in the other G-8 countries ranged from 25 percent in Scotland to 48 percent in England and the russian Federation. In the United States, 40 percent of fourth-graders reached the high benchmark, a larger percentage than in Italy and Scotland but smaller than in England, the russian Federation, and Japan. As at fourth grade, eighth-graders in Japan outperformed their peers in the other participating G-8 countries, with higher percentages of Japanese eighth-graders reaching each of the four benchmarks. The advanced benchmark was reached by 26 percent of Japan's eighth-graders in mathematics, compared with percentages ranging from 3 percent in Italy to 8 percent in the russian Federation and England. In the United States, 6 percent of eighth-graders reached the advanced benchmark. The percentage in the United States was higher than in Scotland and Italy, but lower than in the russian Federation and Japan. In Japan, 61 percent of eighth-graders reached the high benchmark in mathematics; the percentages in the other G-8 countries ranged from 17 percent in Italy to 35 percent in England. In the United States, 31 percent of eighth-graders reached the high benchmark, a larger percentage than in Scotland and Italy.\\nIn TIMSS 2007 at fourth grade, countries were required to sample students in the grade that corresponded to the end of 4 years of formal schooling (the end of primary school), providing that the mean age at the time of testing was at least 9.5 years. At eighth grade, countries were required to sample students in the grade that corresponded to the end of 8 years of formal schooling (the end of lower secondary education), providing that the mean age at the time of testing was at least 13.5 years. TIMSS scores are reported on a scale from 0 to 1,000 with the scale average fixed at 500 and the standard deviation fixed at 100. Since the TIMSS mathematics achievement scales were designed to reliably measure student achievement over time, the metric of the scales was established originally with the 1995 assessment. In order to describe concretely the knowledge and skills attained along the performance scales, TIMSS established four international achievement benchmarks in mathematics and science (low, intermediate, high, and advanced). Four points on the scales were identified for use as international benchmarks: 400 for the low benchmark, 475 for the intermediate benchmark, 550 for the high benchmark, and 625 for the advanced benchmark. These were selected to represent the range of performance shown by students internationally. At the fourth-grade level in mathematics, students at the low benchmark have some basic mathematical knowledge, such as an understanding of whole numbers and the properties of basic geometric shapes. At the intermediate benchmark, students can apply basic mathematical knowledge in straightforward situations, such as performing operations with 3-and 4-digit numbers and decimals and extending simple patterns. At the high benchmark, students can apply their knowledge and understanding to solve multistep word problems involving addition, multiplication, and division and problems requiring the use of data in tables and graphs. Students at the advanced benchmark can apply their understanding and knowledge in a wide variety of relatively complex situations to solve problems involving fractions, decimals, proportions, area, and rotation. At the eighth-grade level in mathematics, students at the low benchmark have some basic mathematical knowledge, such as the ability to do basic computations with whole numbers and reading information from a line on a graph. At the intermediate benchmark, students can apply basic mathematical knowledge in straightforward situations. For example, they can understand simple algebraic relationships, interpret graphs and tables, and perform basic computations to solve one-step word problems involving whole numbers and decimals. Students at the high benchmark can apply their understanding and knowledge in a wide variety of relatively complex situations to solve problems involving fractions, decimals, negative integers, proportions, area, volume, and probability. Students at the advanced benchmark can organize information, make generalizations, solve nonroutine problems, and draw and justify conclusions from data. For example, they can compute percent change, solve simultaneous linear equations, and model simple situations algebraically.\\nIn TIMSS 2007 at fourth grade, countries were required to sample students in the grade that corresponded to the end of 4 years of formal schooling (the end of primary school), providing that the mean age at the time of testing was at least 9.5 years.

That is, to avoid sample size losses resulting from sampled schools not participating, a mechanism was instituted to identify, a priori, substitute schools that have similar characteristics to the sampled schools that they may replace. For England, this applies to eighth grade only. At eighth grade, students in Japan scored higher overall in science and generally had larger percentages of students reaching each of the four international benchmarks compared to their G-8 peers.\\nIn TIMSS 2007 at fourth grade, countries were required to sample students in the grade that corresponded to the end of 4 years of formal schooling (the end of primary school), providing that the mean age at the time of testing was at least 9.5 years.

At the fourth-grade level in science, students at the low benchmark have some elementary knowledge of the Earth, life, and physical sciences, such as simple facts about magnets, electricity, and boiling. At the intermediate benchmark, students can apply basic knowledge and understanding to practical situations in the sciences, such as knowing some basic information about Earth's features and processes, human biology, and health. At the high benchmark, students can apply knowledge and understanding to explain everyday phenomena, such as demonstrating some knowledge of life processes, physical states, and chemical changes. Students at the advanced benchmark can apply knowledge and understanding in beginning scientific inquiry, such as classifying organisms according to major physical and behavioral features. At the eighth-grade level in science, students at the low benchmark recognize some basic facts from the life and physical sciences, including some knowledge about the human body and familiarity with some everyday physical phenomena. Students at the intermediate benchmark can recognize and communicate basic scientific knowledge across a range of topics, including the solar system, human health, and energy. Students at the high benchmark demonstrate conceptual understanding of some science cycles, systems, and principles. For example, they show some understanding of the structure and function of organisms, physical and chemical changes, and major environmental issues. At the advanced benchmark, students demonstrate a grasp of some complex and abstract science concepts. For example, they can apply understanding of the complexity of living organisms and how they relate to their environment.\\nIn TIMSS 2007 at fourth grade, countries were required to sample students in the grade that corresponded to the end of 4 years of formal schooling (the end of primary school), providing that the mean age at the time of testing was at least 9.5 years.

Data for Germany are only available at the fourth grade, as Germany did not participate in TIMSS 2007 at the eighth grade. 1 Met international guidelines for participation rates only after substitute schools were included. That is, to avoid sample size losses resulting from sampled schools not participating, a mechanism was instituted to identify, a priori, substitute schools that have similar characteristics to the sampled schools that they may replace. For England, this applies to eighth-grade only. Average scores of 15-year-old students on the combined science literacy scale ranged from 475 in Italy to 534 in Canada, with the United States at 489 (figure 10). The U.S. average score was lower than the average score of 500 for the participating Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries (Baldi et al. 2007). Among the G-8 countries, the U.S. average score was lower than the average scores of the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, and Canada; higher than the average score of Italy; and not measurably different from the average scores of the russian Federation and France. U.S. 15-year-olds scored lower, on average, than their peers in the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, and Canada on the three science literacy subscales. The U.S. average score of 492 on the identifying scientific issues subscale was lower than the average scores of Germany (510), the United Kingdom (514), Japan 522, and Canada (532) (figure 10). However, students in the United States outperformed their peers in Italy (474) and the russian Federation (463) on this subscale. Among the G-8 countries, students in Canada had the highest score on the identifying scientific issues subscale. On the explaining phenomena scientifically subscale, 15-year-olds in Canada scored higher, on average, than their peers in all other G-8 countries except for Japan (there was no measurable difference between Canada and Japan on this subscale). U.S. students had an average score of 486 and were outperformed by students in the United Kingdom (517), Germany (519), Japan 527, and Canada (531). Unlike the identifying scientific issues subscale, U.S. students did not perform better, on average, than their peers in any other G-8 country on this subscale. On the using scientific evidence subscale, students in Japan and Canada scored higher, on average, than their peers in all other G-8 countries. U.S. students had an average score of 489 and were outperformed, on average, by students in France (511), the United Kingdom (514), Germany (515), Canada (542), and Japan (544). However, students in the United States outperformed their peers in Italy (467) on this subscale.\\nIn PISA, \\\"15-year-olds\\\" refers to students between 15 years and 3 months to 16 years and 2 months old at the time of the assessment and who have completed at least 6 years of formal schooling. PISA defines scientific literacy as \\\"an individual's scientific knowledge and use of that knowledge to identify questions, to acquire new knowledge, to explain scientific phenomena, and to draw evidencebased conclusions about science-related issues, understanding of the characteristic features of science as a form of human knowledge and inquiry, awareness of how science and technology shape our material, intellectual, and cultural environments, and willingness to engage in science-related issues, and with the ideas of science, as a reflective citizen\\\" (OECD 2006, p. 12). In PISA 2006, students were assessed on their scientific literacy in relation to scientific knowledge or concepts, scientific processes, and situations or contexts, which were reflected in three subscales (identifying scientific issues, explaining phenomena scientifically, and using scientific evidence). The identifying scientific issues subscale includes recognizing issues that are possible to investigate scientifically; identifying keywords to search for scientific information; and recognizing the key features of a scientific investigation. The explaining phenomena scientifically subscale includes applying knowledge of science in a given situation; describing or interpreting phenomena scientifically and predicting changes; and identifying appropriate descriptions, explanations, and predictions. The using scientific evidence subscale includes interpreting scientific evidence and making and communicating conclusions; identifying the assumptions, evidence, and reasoning behind conclusions; and reflecting on the societal implications of science and technological developments. Scores on the PISA 2006 combined science literacy scale are reported on a scale from 0 to 1,000 with the OECD average fixed at 500 and the standard deviation fixed at 100.\\nIn PISA, \\\"15-year-olds\\\" refers to students between 15 years and 3 months to 16 years and 2 months old at the time of the assessment and who have completed at least 6 years of formal schooling.

Scores on the PISA 2006 combined science literacy scale are reported on a scale from 0 to 1,000 with the OECD average fixed at 500 and the standard deviation fixed at 100. Science proficiency was defined in terms of six levels (levels 1 through 6) based on student performance scores on the combined science literacy scale. Exact cut point scores are as follows: level 6 (a score greater than 707.93); level 5 (a score greater than 633.33 and less than or equal to 707.93); level 4 (a score greater than 558.73 and less than or equal to 633.33); level 3 (a score greater than 484.14 and less than or equal to 558.73); level 2 (a score greater than 409.54 and less than or equal to 484.14); and level 1 (a score greater than 334.94 and less than or equal to 409.54). Students who perform below level 1 (a score less than or equal to 334.94) \\\"\\u2026are unable to demonstrate science competencies in situations required by the easiest PISA tasks\\u2026 such a low level of science competency can be regarded as putting them at a serious disadvantage for full participation in society and the economy\\\" (OECD 2007a, p. 42). In order to reach a particular proficiency level, a student must have been able to correctly answer a majority of items at that level. Students at each succeeding level are capable of solving science problems of increasing complexity. Students proficient at level 1 have such a limited scientific knowledge that it can only be applied to a few, familiar situations. They can present scientific explanations that are obvious and that follow explicitly from given evidence. Students at level 2 have adequate scientific knowledge to provide possible explanations or draw conclusions based on simple investigations; they are capable of direct reasoning and making literal interpretations of the results of scientific inquiry or technological problem solving. At level 3, students can identify clearly described scientific issues in a range of contexts; they can directly apply simple models or inquiry strategies to explain phenomena, interpret and use scientific concepts, and can make decisions based on scientific knowledge. At level 4, students can work effectively with situations that may involve explicit phenomena requiring them to make inferences about the role of science; they can select, integrate, and link explanations from different disciplines of science to real-world situations; they can reflect on their actions and can communicate decisions using scientific evidence. Students at level 5 can identify the scientific components of many complex real-world situations and can apply scientific concepts to these situations and evaluate scientific evidence; they can use well-developed inquiry abilities, bring critical insights to situations, and construct explanations based on evidence and arguments based on their critical analysis. Students proficient at level 6 clearly and consistently demonstrate advanced scientific thinking and reasoning, demonstrate willingness to use their scientific understanding in support of solutions to unfamiliar situations, and can develop real-world arguments based on scientific knowledge. For more information about how proficiency levels were set for PISA 2006, see the technical appendix in Baldi et al. (2007 \\nIn PISA, \\\"15-year-olds\\\" refers to students between 15 years and 3 months to 16 years and 2 months old at the at the time of the assessment and who have completed at least 6 years of formal schooling. Scores on the PISA 2006 combined science literacy scale are reported on a scale from 0 to 1,000 with the OECD average fixed at 500 and the standard deviation fixed at 100. For more information about science literacy in PISA 2006, see the Definitions and Methodology section of indicators 10 and 11. Parent occupational status is measured by the Highest International Socioeconomic Index of Occupational Status (HISEI), which corresponds to the highest occupational index score of the student's father or mother. Parental occupation, as reported by the student, was coded based on the current version of the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO-88) (International Labor Organization 1988). Occupational codes were, in turn, mapped onto an internationally comparable index of occupational status, the International Socioeconomic Index of Occupational Status (ISEI), developed by Ganzeboom, De Graaf, and Treiman (1992). The ISEI captures the attributes of occupations that convert parents' education into income. It is derived by optimally scaling occupation groups to maximize the indirect effect of education on income through occupation and to minimize the direct effect of education on income, net of occupation (both effects being net of age). As discussed in this indicator, students were also classified into national quarters on the ISEI. , which corresponds to the highest occupational index score of the student's father or mother. This information, derived from students' responses to questionnaire items pertaining to parental occupation, is transformed into an index developed by Ganzeboom, De Graaf, and Treiman (1992 (PISA 2006), this indicator compares 15-year-old students' science achievement by immigration status across the G-8 countries. In PISA 2006, the student background questionnaire asked 15-year-olds to report if they were native (born in the country of assessment with at least one of their parents born in the same country), or had an immigrant background within two generations. Students not reporting native also reported if they were second generation (born in the country of assessment but with parents born in another country), or first generation (born in another country and with parents born in another country). 16 In 2006, 15 percent of U.S. 15-year-olds had an immigrant background within two generations; of these, 9 percent reported being second generation students and 6 percent reported being first generation students (figure 13a). The U.S. percentage of students with an immigrant background within two generations (15 percent) was higher than the corresponding percentage for the russian Federation (9 percent), the United Kingdom (9 percent), Italy (4 percent), and Japan (0.4 percent), but lower than that for Canada (21 percent).\\nIn PISA, \\\"15-year-olds\\\" refers to students between 15 years and 3 months to 16 years and 2 months old at the at the time of the assessment and who have completed at least 6 years of formal schooling. Students were tested in the language of instruction used in their school. Multilingual countries developed as many versions of the test instruments as there were languages of instruction used in the schools included in their national sample. PISA was designed to be as inclusive as possible. Each participating country attempted to maximize the coverage of 15-year-olds enrolled in education in its national sample so that results would be representative of the entire national school system. Thus, efforts were made to ensure that exclusions at the school or student level, if they were necessary, were minimized according to the PISA technical standards. Countries might find it necessary to reduce their coverage of the target population by excluding, for example, a small, remote geographical region due to inaccessibility. Instances where minority languages were used in only a very limited number of schools could be excluded from the target population if this was determined not to affect the overall quality of the data collection. Within schools, students could be excluded for being intellectually disabled, functionally disabled, or having insufficient language experience. Students were not to be excluded solely because of poor academic performance or normal discipline problems. With respect to insufficient language experience, students could be excluded only if they met the following three criteria: not being native speakers in the assessment language, having limited proficiency in the assessment language, and receiving less than 1 year of instruction in the assessment language. The sampling standards used in PISA permitted countries to exclude up to a total of 5 percent of the relevant population for approved reasons. All G-8 countries achieved this standard except for Canada, which had an overall exclusion rate of 6 percent. Canada's withinschool exclusion rate was 5 percent. In all other G-8 countries, the within-school exclusion rates ranged from 0 percent in Japan to 4 percent in the United States. (See OECD 2009 for additional details about exclusions, including procedures, criteria, and rates.) Scores on the PISA 2006 combined science literacy scale are reported on a scale from 0 to 1,000 with the OECD average fixed at 500 and the standard deviation fixed at 100. For more information about science literacy in PISA 2006, see the Definitions and Methodology section of indicators 10 and 11. The computations presented in the text were carried out using unrounded numbers; therefore, they may differ from computations made using the rounded numbers that appear in figures 13a and 13b.

Using data from the 2006 Progress in International reading Literacy Study (PIrLS 2006), this indicator presents the reports of teachers of fourth-graders about how much time in a typical week they spend on reading instruction. As reported in this indicator, the average number of hours spent on reading instruction is grouped into three categories: 3 hours or less, more than 3 and up to and including 6 hours, and more than 6 hours. Teachers' reports of the average number of hours spent on reading instruction each week generally varied widely both across and within the participating G-8 countries 18 (figure 14). For example, in 2006, the percentage of fourth-graders whose teachers reported spending 3 hours or less in a typical week on reading instruction ranged from 10 percent in the United States to 71 percent in Germany. This category was reported more frequently than the other two categories in three G-8 countries, including Germany (71 percent), England (67 percent), and Italy (51 percent). For the category of more than 3 and up to and including 6 hours of reading instruction, the percentages ranged from 22 percent in the United States to 60 percent in the russian Federation. This category was reported more frequently than the other two categories in two G-8 countries, including the russian Federation (60 percent) and France (48 percent). For the category of more than 6 hours of reading instruction, the percentages ranged from 6 percent in Germany to 68 percent in the United States. The United States not only had the highest percentage of fourth-graders with teachers who reported spending more than 6 hours on reading instruction in a typical week, but it also was the only participating G-8 country to cite this category more frequently than any other category. Data for this indicator are from the PIrLS 2006 fourth-grade teacher questionnaire, which was administered to the teachers of the students sampled for PIrLS. The questionnaire included questions on teachers' background and on their teaching practices in the sampled students' classes. One or two classes were randomly sampled in each school, and teachers were asked to complete a questionnaire for each class they taught that contained sampled students. Thus, if a teacher taught two classes with sampled students, he or she was expected to complete a questionnaire for each of these classes. It should be noted that the PIrLS 2006 fourth-grade teachers do not constitute representative samples of teachers. rather, they are the teachers for nationally representative samples of fourth-grade students. Thus, the teacher data presented in this indicator were analyzed at the student level. In PIrLS 2006, countries were required to sample students in the grade that corresponded to the end of 4 years of formal schooling, France,Germany,Italy,Russian Federation,Scotland,United States providing that the mean age at the time of testing was at least 9.5 years. As defined by PIrLS, the 1st year of formal schooling begins with the 1st year of primary school (ISCED97 level 1), which should mark the beginning of formal instruction in reading, writing, and mathematics. Note that kindergarten is not counted. For most countries, the target grade was fourth grade, or its national equivalent.\\nTeachers' reports of how much time in a typical week is spent on reading instruction are based on the following question: \\\"regardless of whether or not you have formally scheduled time for reading instruction, in a typical week about how much time do you spend on reading instruction and/or activities with the students? Include things you do across curriculum areas and during formally scheduled time for reading instruction.\\\" Teachers were asked to write in the hours and minutes per week.  PIrLS 2006), this indicator presents teachers' reports about the strategies that they used to help fourth-graders having difficulty reading. Teachers were given a list of strategies and asked whether each one was used if a student begins to fall behind in reading. In 2006, a combination of strategies was reportedly used to varying degrees in the participating G-8 countries 19 to assist students having difficulty reading. One of the most common strategies was to ask parents to help their child with reading (table 4). The percentage of fourth-graders whose teachers reported asking parents to help their child with reading ranged from 84 percent in France to 99 percent in the russian Federation and England. In the United States, this strategy was used more frequently than any of the others; 97 percent of fourth-graders had a teacher who reported using it. A second strategy commonly used to assist students having difficulty reading was working with students individually. The percentage of fourth-graders whose teachers reported working with students individually ranged from 78 percent in England to 92 percent in Scotland and Italy. In the United States, 89 percent of fourth-graders had a teacher who reported doing this. In Italy, Scotland, and France, working with students individually was done about as frequently as asking the parents to help their child with reading. A third strategy commonly used by several G-8 countries to assist students having difficulty reading was to have the student work with other students; its reported use ranged from 45 percent in Scotland to 83 percent in Italy. In the United States 80 percent of fourth-graders had a teacher who reported using this strategy. There were a few strategies for assisting students having difficulty reading where reported use varied considerably across the G-8 countries. For example, the percentage of fourth-graders who had a teacher who reported assigning homework to help the student catch up ranged from 23 percent in France to 94 percent in the russian Federation, with the United States at 45 percent. The reported use of the strategy of having the student work in the regular classroom with a teacher aide ranged from 8 percent in Germany to 72 percent in England, with the United States at 31 percent. The reported use of the strategy of waiting to see if performance improves with maturation ranged from 17 percent in Scotland to 65 percent in the russian Federation, with the United States at 32 percent. A reading specialist may also be used to assist students having difficulty reading. In most of the G-8 countries, this was more likely to take place in a remedial classroom than in the regular classroom. For example, in England, the United States, and Scotland, about half of fourth-graders had a teacher who reported having students work in a remedial classroom with a reading specialist, which compares to 28, 15, and 18 percent, respectively, for having students work in the regular classroom with a reading specialist. PIrLS also asked teachers of fourth-graders about their access to remedial reading specialists. Thirty-four percent of fourth-graders in the United States and 24 percent of fourth-graders in England had teachers who reported always having a remedial reading specialist available (figure 15). Less than 10 percent of fourth-graders in France, Germany, and Italy had teachers who reported always having a remedial reading specialist available. England had the lowest percentage of fourth-graders whose teachers never had access to a remedial reading specialist (16 percent), while Italy had the highest (95 percent). In the United States, 29 percent of fourth-graders had teachers who reported never having access to a remedial reading specialist.\\nData for this indicator are from the PIrLS 2006 fourth-grade teacher questionnaire, which was administered to the teachers of the students sampled for PIrLS. The questionnaire included questions on teachers' background and on their teaching practices in the sampled students' classes. One or two classes were randomly sampled in each school, and teachers were asked to complete a questionnaire for each class they taught that contained sampled students.

Note that kindergarten is not counted. For most countries, the target grade was fourth grade, or its national equivalent. Teachers' reports about whether or not they used various strategies to help fourth-graders who are having difficulty reading are based on the percentages of students whose teachers responded \\\"yes\\\" to a list of strategies that follow the question, \\\"What do you usually do if a student begins to fall behind in reading?\\\" Teachers' reports about the availability of remedial reading specialists to assist fourth-graders who are having difficulty reading were based on teachers' responses to the question, \\\"Are the following resources available to you to deal with students who have difficulty with reading?\\\" As shown in figure 15, results are based on the percentages of students whose teachers responded \\\"always,\\\" \\\"sometimes,\\\" or \\\"never\\\" to the availability of a remedial reading specialist either in the classroom or in a remedial reading classroom.  \\nData for this indicator are from the PIrLS fourth-grade teacher questionnaire, which was administered to the teachers of the students sampled for PIrLS in 2001 and 2006. The questionnaire included questions on teachers' background and on their teaching practices in the sampled students' classes. One or two classes were randomly sampled in each school, and teachers were asked to complete a questionnaire for each class they taught that contained sampled students. Thus, if a teacher taught two classes with sampled students, he or she was expected to complete a questionnaire for each of these classes. It should be noted that the PIrLS fourth-grade teachers do not constitute representative samples of teachers in 2001 and 2006. rather, they are the teachers for nationally representative samples of fourth-grade students. Thus, the teacher data presented in this indicator were analyzed at the student level. In PIrLS 2006, countries were required to sample students in the grade that corresponded to the end of 4 years of formal schooling, providing that the mean age at the time of testing was at least 9.5 years.

Note that kindergarten is not counted. For most countries, the target grade was fourth grade, or its national equivalent. For teachers' reports of their age, teachers were given the following response options in the PIrLS teacher questionnaire: (1) under 25; (2) 25 to 29; (3) 30 to 39; (4) 40 to 49; (5) 50 to 59; or (6) 60 or more. For the purposes of this indicator, the bottom two categories were combined and the top two categories were combined. The categories of \\\"29 years or younger\\\" and \\\"50 years or older\\\" were used in this indicator in order to highlight the percentage of fourth-graders with beginning teachers and the percentage with teachers nearing retirement. As presented in the text or shown in figure 16a, differences from 2001 to 2006 were computed from unrounded numbers; therefore, they may differ from computations made using the rounded numbers cited in the text or shown in figure 16b.\\nIn this indicator, the term \\\"teaching hours\\\" refers to \\\"net teaching hours,\\\" which are calculated as follows: annual number of weeks of instruction multiplied by the minimum/maximum number of periods that a teacher is supposed to spend teaching a class or group multiplied by the length of a period in minutes and divided by 60. Periods of time formally allowed for breaks between lessons or group of lessons, and days when schools are closed for public holidays and festivities, are excluded. Working time refers to the normal working hours of a full-time teacher. According to the formal policy in a given country, working time can refer either to the time directly associated with teaching (and other curricular \\u2022 activities for students such as administering assignments and tests, but excluding annual examinations); or the time directly associated with teaching as well as the time \\u2022 devoted to other activities related to teaching (such as lesson preparation, counseling students, correcting assignments and tests, professional development, meetings with parents, staff meetings, and general school tasks). Working time does not include paid overtime. Working time required at school refers to the working time teachers are supposed to be at school, including teaching time and nonteaching time. Statutory working time refers to the normal working hours of a fulltime teacher and includes net teaching hours (i.e., the time directly associated with teaching) as well as nonteaching hours devoted to activities related to teaching, such as lesson preparation, counseling students, and correcting assignments and tests. Statutory working time may include nonteaching time not spent at school. Teaching staff include professional personnel directly involved in teaching students. The classification includes classroom teachers; special education teachers; and other teachers who work with a whole class of students in a classroom, in small groups in a resource room, or in one-to-one teaching situations inside or outside a regular classroom. Teaching staff also includes department chairpersons whose duties include some teaching, but excludes non-professional personnel who support teachers in providing instruction to students, such as teachers' aides and other paraprofessional personnel.\\nData for this indicator are from the TIMSS 2007 teacher questionnaire, which was designed to obtain information about the classroom contexts for the teaching and learning of mathematics and science and about the implemented curriculum in these subjects. For each participating school, one teacher questionnaire that addressed both mathematics and science was administered to the classroom teacher of the sampled fourth-grade class, and separate versions of the questionnaire were administered to the mathematics teacher and the science teacher of the sampled eighth-grade class. It should be noted that the TIMSS 2007 teachers do not constitute representative samples of teachers. rather, they are the teachers for nationally representative samples of fourth-grade and eighth-grade students. Thus, the teacher data presented in this indicator were analyzed at the student level. In TIMSS 2007 at fourth grade, countries were required to sample students in the grade that corresponded to the end of 4 years of formal schooling (the end of primary school), providing that the mean age at the time of testing was at least 9.5 years. At eighth grade, countries were required to sample students in the grade that corresponded to the end of 8 years of formal schooling (the end of lower secondary education), providing that the mean age at the time of testing was at least 13.5 years.\\nData for this indicator are from the TIMSS 2007 teacher questionnaire, which was designed to obtain information about the classroom contexts for the teaching and learning of mathematics and science and about the implemented curriculum in these subjects.

At all schools with participating 15-year-old students, a school questionnaire was administered to the principal. It should be noted that the PISA 2006 principals do not constitute representative samples of principals. rather, they are the principals for nationally representative samples of 15-year-old students. Thus, the school data presented in this indicator were analyzed at the student level. In PISA, \\\"15-year-olds\\\" refers to students between 15 years and 3 months to 16 years and 2 months old at the time of the assessment and who have completed at least 6 years of formal schooling. As stated in the school questionnaire, achievement data include aggregated school or grade-level test scores or grades, or graduation rates.  In 2007, about 39 percent of U.S. eighth-graders had principals who reported at least a weekly occurrence of intimidation or verbal abuse of other students, which is higher than in all other participating G-8 countries. Using eighth-grade data from the 2007 Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS 2007), this indicator presents school principals' reports of both the incidence of behaviors that threaten a safe and orderly environment and their perceptions of these behaviors as a \\\"serious\\\" problem. It should be noted that what constitutes a \\\"serious\\\" problem may differ from one country to another. A relatively low number of threatening behaviors may be perceived as a \\\"serious\\\" problem in one country, but not in another, because of cultural differences and other factors. Of the seven problem behaviors shown in figure 21a, classroom disturbance was the most frequently cited in the United States. Across the participating G-8 countries, 24 the percentage of eighthgraders whose principals reported at least a weekly occurrence of a classroom disturbance ranged from 8 percent in Japan to 60 percent in Scotland, with the United States at 55 percent. The U.S. percentage was higher than in the russian Federation and Japan but not measurably different from that in the other participating G-8 countries. The U.S. percentage for classroom disturbance in 2007 was lower than in 1999, when 69 percent of U.S. eighth-graders were in schools whose principals reported at least a weekly occurrence of a classroom disturbance (see indicator 14 in Sherman, Honegger, and McGivern 2003). In 2007, intimidation or verbal abuse of other students was cited second most frequently in the United States. The percentage of eighth-graders in schools whose principals reported at least a weekly occurrence of intimidation or verbal abuse of other students ranged from 1 percent in the russian Federation to 39 percent in the United States, with the U.S. percentage higher than in all other participating G-8 countries. In Japan, compared with other participating G-8 countries, relatively low percentages of eighth-graders had principals who reported problem behaviors occurring at least weekly, with a range from 1 percent for both cheating and theft to 8 percent for classroom disturbance. There were lower percentages of students in Japan than in England, Italy, Scotland, and the United States whose principals reported that classroom disturbances and intimidation or verbal abuse of other students occurred at least weekly. Figure 21b shown principals' perceptions of these behaviors as a \\\"serious\\\" problem. In the United States in 2007, intimidation or verbal abuse of other students was cited most frequently as a serious problem (26 percent), followed by classroom disturbance (17 percent). 25 The percentage of U.S. eighth-graders whose principals reported intimidation or verbal abuse of other students as a serious problem was about 10 percentage points higher in 2007 than in 1999 (see indicator 14 in Sherman, Honegger, and McGivern 2003). In 2007, the percentages of eighth-graders in Japan whose principals reported the problem behaviors as serious problems ranged from 24 percent for cheating to 39 percent for intimidation or verbal abuse of other students. No particular behavior was cited most frequently as a serious problem in Japan (i.e., no measurable differences at the high end of the range). In Italy, the percentages of eighth-graders whose principals reported the problem behaviors as serious problems ranged from 8 percent for cheating to 31 percent for classroom disturbance. Classroom disturbance was cited more frequently as a serious problem in Italy than all other behaviors except intimidation or verbal abuse of other students (there was no measurable difference in reports of these two behaviors as serious problems). In England, the russian Federation, and Scotland, the percentages of eighth-graders whose principals reported the problem behaviors as serious problems were no higher than 8 percent for all of the behaviors.\\nData for this indicator are from the TIMSS 2007 eighth-grade school questionnaire, which asked school principals of the eighth-graders tested to provide information about curricular and instructional arrangements, school resources, and school climate. It should be noted that the TIMSS 2007 school principals do not constitute representative samples of school principals. rather, they are the school principals for nationally representative samples of eighthgrade students. Thus, the school data presented in this indicator were analyzed at the student level. Countries were required to sample students in the grade that corresponded to the end of 8 years of formal schooling (the end of lower secondary education), providing that the mean age at the time of testing was at least 13.5 years. As the data for this indicator, school principals were asked the following questions on the eighth-grade school questionnaire: \\\"How often does each of the following problem behaviors occur among eighth-grade students in your school? If the behavior occurs, how severe a problem does it present?\\\" The behaviors specified in the question were as follows: arriving late at school; absenteeism (i.e., unjustified absences); skipping class hours/periods; violating dress code; classroom disturbance; cheating; profanity; vandalism; theft; intimidation or verbal abuse of other students; physical injury to other students; intimidation or verbal abuse of teachers or staff; and physical injury to teachers or staff. The results for seven of these problem behaviors are presented in this indicator. response options for frequency included \\\"never,\\\" \\\"rarely,\\\" \\\"monthly,\\\" \\\"weekly,\\\" and \\\"daily.\\\" For this analysis, the latter two categories were combined. response options for the severity of the problem included \\\"not a problem,\\\" \\\"minor problem,\\\" and \\\"serious problem.\\\" For the reports of a behavior as a serious problem, the denominator for the percentages is students at all schools, not just students at schools whose principals report the occurrence of the behavior at least weekly.  This indicator presents a cross-country comparison of the average annual salaries of full-time public school teachers with the minimum training necessary to be fully qualified at the beginning of their teaching careers. Comparisons are presented across two education levels: primary and upper secondary. The indicator also compares the ratio of these average starting salaries to the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita for each of the reporting countries. Of the G-8 countries reporting data in 2006, Germany reported the highest average starting salary of public school teachers at both the primary and upper secondary levels (primary: $40,300; upper secondary: $45,200) (figure 22). The United States paid the second highest average starting salary to public school teachers at both levels (primary: $34,900; upper secondary: $33,700). France reported the lowest average starting salary at both levels (primary: $23,300; upper secondary: $26,000). In most G-8 countries in 2006, public school teachers at the beginning of their careers earned less than the average GDP per capita in their respective countries (table  6). For example, in the United States, the GDP per capita was about $43,800, and the average starting salary of such teachers was about 80 percent of the U.S. GDP per capita. In Germany, however, public primary and upper secondary school teachers at the beginning of their careers earned 126 and 141 percent, respectively, of the German GDP per capita. Included: England, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Scotland, United States Definitions and Methodology Teacher salary data are from the 2007 OECD Indicators of National Education Systems (INES) Survey on Teachers and the Curriculum and refer to the school year 2005-06. Data for GDP per capita are for calendar year 2006. Dollar figures for teacher salaries and GDP per capita were converted to U.S. equivalent dollars using purchasing power parities (PPPs), which equalize the purchasing power of different currencies. PPP exchange rate data are from the 2005-06 OECD National Accounts Database (OECD 2008b). Using PPPs to convert all teacher salary data to US equivalent dollars allows for cost of living differences across countries to be taken into account.\\nPer student expenditure is based on public and private full-timeequivalent (FTE) enrollment figures for the 2004-05 school year and current expenditure and capital outlays from both public and private sources, where data are available. Data for GDP per capita are for calendar year 2005. Dollar figures for education expenditure and GDP per capita were converted to U.S. equivalent dollars using purchasing power parities (PPPs), which equalize the purchasing power of different currencies. Using PPPs to convert all education expenditure data to US equivalent dollars allows for cost of living differences across countries to be taken into account. Within-country consumer price indices are used to adjust the PPP indices to account for inflation because the fiscal year has a different starting date in different countries. The national averages shown here do not represent the withincountry variation that may exist in the annual education expenditure per student.

The summations presented in the text were carried out using unrounded numbers; therefore, they may differ from summations made using the rounded numbers that appear in figure 25.   In the United States and all other G-8 countries reporting data, higher employment rates were associated with higher levels of educational attainment. In all reporting countries except the United Kingdom, between 52 and 58 percent of adults ages 25 to 64 whose highest educational attainment was lower secondary education or below were employed in 2006 (figure 26a). This compares to a range from 73 to 76 percent for adults whose highest educational attainment was upper secondary education 27 and from 81 to 86 percent for adults who had completed academic higher education, excluding the United Kingdom. For example, among U.S. adults in 2006, about 58 percent of those whose highest educational attainment was lower secondary education or below were employed, compared with 73 percent of those whose highest educational attainment was upper secondary education and 83 percent of those who had completed academic higher education. The United Kingdom had higher employment rates than all other reporting G-8 countries at all three levels of educational attainment (66, 81, and 89 percent, respectively). The gaps in employment rates for 25-to 64-year-olds at the highest and lowest levels of educational attainment (i.e., the difference in the employment rates for academic higher education and lower secondary education or below), ranged from 23 percentage points in the United Kingdom and France to 31 percentage points in Germany (figure 26a). In the United States, the gap was 25 percentage points. Figure 26b shows employment rates separately for males and females. In all reporting G-8 countries, males who had completed lower secondary education or below, upper secondary education, or academic higher education had higher employment rates than did females with a comparable amount of education. For males whose highest educational attainment was lower secondary education or below, employment rates ranged from 65 percent (Germany) to 72 percent (the United Kingdom). For females, the corresponding range was 33 percent (Italy) to 61 percent (the United Kingdom). In the United States, 70 percent of males and 44 percent of females whose highest educational attainment was lower secondary education or below were employed in 2006. For males whose highest educational attainment was upper secondary education, employment rates ranged from 78 percent (Germany) to 87 percent (Japan). For females, the corresponding range was 60 percent (Japan) to 76 percent (United Kingdom). In the United States, 80 percent of males and 67 percent of females whose highest educational attainment was upper secondary education were employed in 2006. In all reporting G-8 countries, at least 85 percent of males who had completed academic higher education were employed in 2006. For females who had completed academic higher education, employment rates ranged from 68 percent (Japan) to 87 percent (United Kingdom). In the United States, 88 percent of males and 78 percent of females who had completed academic higher education were employed in 2006. In most of the reporting G-8 countries, the gap in employment rates between males and females was largest among adults whose highest educational attainment was lower secondary education or below and smallest among adults who had completed academic higher education. In all reporting G-8 countries except Japan, the male-female gap for lower secondary education or below was approximately two to four times the size of the gap for academic higher education. Italy had the largest male-female gap at the level of lower secondary education or below (38 percentage points). In Japan, the male-female gap was 28 percentage points among adults who had completed upper secondary education and 27 percentage points among adults who had completed academic higher education; these gaps were larger than those in all other reporting G-8 countries at these levels. In the United States, the male-female gap was 27, 13, and 10 percentage points among adults who had completed lower secondary education or below, upper secondary education, and academic higher education, respectively.\\nThe employment rate of adults at a particular level of educational attainment is calculated as the number of individuals ages 25 to 64 with the particular level of educational attainment who are in employment divided by the number of individuals ages 25 to 64 with the same level of educational attainment. As shown in the figures, education levels are defined according to the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED97). For more information on the ISCED97 levels, see appendix A. Individuals whose highest level of education is academic higher education have completed at least a first university degree program, which prepares students for advanced research and highly qualified professions. First university degree programs vary in duration in different countries in different programs of study. In the United States, the first university degree corresponds to a bachelor's degree; it excludes associate's degrees. Percentage-point differences presented in the text were computed from unrounded numbers; therefore, they may differ from computations made using the rounded whole numbers that appear in the figures.\\nIncome refers to pretax income.

International comparisons of salaries provide simplified illustrations of the compensation received by teachers for their work. They provide a snapshot of the systems of compensation and the welfare inferences that can be made. Differences by country in taxation and social benefit systems as well as the use of financial incentives (including regional allowances for teaching in remote regions, family allowances, reduced rates on public transport, tax allowances on purchases of cultural goods, and other entitlements that contribute to a teacher's basic income) make it important to exercise caution in interpreting comparisons of teachers' salaries. Countries with centralized systems of education typically have national salary schedules. In countries like the United States, with decentralized education systems, local or regional governments establish their own salary schedules. The national averages shown here do not represent the within-country variation that exists in teacher salaries. The minimum training necessary to be fully qualified varies by country. In the United States, teacher training is decentralized and varies by state.

Students who failed to answer correctly more than half of the items associated with level 1 were categorized as having proficiency below level 1.

      "        \"text\": \"In 2006, U.S. students from families with low occupational status were outperformed by students from families with low occupational status in the United Kingdom, Germany, Canada, and Japan in science literacy. The Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) measured the occupational status of the 15-year-old student's mother or father (whichever parent had the higher occupational status), with parental occupation reported by the student. Parental occupations were translated into index scores. A low index score (i.e., between 16 and 34 points) corresponds with a parental occupation requiring a minimal level of education (e.g., taxi driver, waiter/waitress), and a high index score (i.e., between 71 and 90 points) corresponds with a parental occupation requiring a high level of education (e.g., medical doctor, university professor). This indicator focuses on the relationship between parent occupational status and science achievement as measured in PISA 2006. results from PISA showed that U.S. students tended to come from homes with parents whose occupations required comparatively higher levels of education relative to their peers in other G-8 countries. In 2006, the United States and Canada had the highest mean occupational index scores of all the G-8 countries, which is similar to what was found in PISA in 2003. 15 In 2006, the range across the G-8 countries was from 46.4 in Italy to 53.5 in Canada, with the United States at 52.5 (OECD 2007b). Furthermore, when students were classified into national quarters on the occupational index, U.S. 15-year-olds in the bottom national quarter had a higher mean index score than their peers in Italy, France, Germany, and the russian Federation (29.9 in the United States compared to a range from 27.2 in Italy to 29.5 in the russian Federation). In Canada and Japan, students in the bottom national quarter had a higher mean index score (32.7 and 34.2, respectively) than their U.S. counterparts. These results showed that parent occupational status was generally higher for U.S. students compared to their G-8 peers. Among those students from families with low occupational status relative to other students in their country, U.S. students tended to have parents whose occupations required comparatively higher levels of education relative to their peers in other G-8 countries. On the other hand, when looking at the science achievement of those students from families with low occupational status, U.S. students did not perform higher than their counterparts in any G-8 country. U.S. students in the bottom national quarter of the occupational index were outperformed by students in the bottom national quarter of the index in the United Kingdom, Germany, Canada, and Japan on the PISA 2006 combined science literacy scale (445 in the United States compared to a range from 472 in the United Kingdom to 506 in Japan) (figure 12a). Nevertheless, within all G-8 countries, there was a relationship between parent occupational status and students' achievement scores. Specifically, students in the top national quarter of the occupational index scored higher on the combined science literacy scale than students in the bottom national quarter of the index. This difference ranged from 53 points in Japan to 111 points in France; in the United States, this difference was 97 points. Another way to evaluate the relationship between parent occupational status and science achievement is to examine the specific change in score on the combined science literacy scale in response to a one-standard-deviation increase (i.e., 17.1 units) in the occupational index score. A greater increase in a country's average achievement score per one-standard-deviation increase in the occupational index score implies a stronger relationship between parent occupational status and performance in that country. Across the G-8 countries, an increase of one standard deviation on the index was associated with an average performance increase that ranged from 19 score points in Japan to 42 score points in France (figure 12b). In the United States, an increase of one standard deviation on the index was associated with an average performance increase of 36 score points. Compared to the United States, four G-8 countries had a weaker relationship between the occupational index and science literacy performance-Japan, the russian Federation, Canada, and Italy-and the other G-8 countries were not measurably different from the United States in this regard.\"\n",

It should be noted that these results are generally based on the amount of time that teachers are contracted to work and do not take into account the possible variation in the number of hours teachers actually work. In 2006, teachers in the United States at the primary, lower secondary, and upper secondary levels were contracted to teach an average of 1,080 hours during the school year (figure 17).

Besides the United States, the only other reporting G-8 country with the same number of teaching hours at the three education levels was Scotland (893 hours). In France, Germany, and Italy, primary school teachers were contracted to work more teaching hours than lower and upper secondary teachers; of these three countries, France reported the greatest differential, with 276 more hours for primary school teachers than for lower secondary school teachers, and 294 more hours for primary school teachers than for upper secondary school teachers. The only reporting G-8 country in which primary school teachers spent fewer contracted hours teaching than lower and upper secondary teachers was the russian Federation, with 290 fewer hours for primary school teachers. regulations on working time vary across the G-8 countries (see table 5). England and the United States specify the number of hours that teachers are required to be at school. Germany, Japan and Scotland specify statutory working time, which can occur at school or elsewhere. Although teachers in the United States were contracted to teach more hours than their peers in the other reporting G-8 countries, they worked less total hours than their peers in Japan and Germany when working time was defined not only as time spent on teaching but also as time spent on other work-related activities. For all three education levels, the statutory working time for teachers in Japan (1,952 hours per year) and Germany (1,765 hours per year) exceeded U.S. teachers' working time required at school (primary: 1,332 hours per year; lower and upper secondary: 1,368 hours per year). England required fewer total hours spent on teaching and other work-related activities (1,265 hours per year) than all other reporting G-8 countries and at all three education levels.\"\n",

(TIMSS 2007) asked teachers of fourth-and eighth-graders to report on their participation in several areas of professional development in science in the 2 years before the assessment. This indicator discusses the results for teachers of fourth-and eighth-graders in four areas of science: content, pedagogy/instruction, improving students' critical thinking or problem-solving skills, and assessment. In 2007, the percentage of fourth-graders whose teachers reported participating in professional development in science content in the previous 2 years ranged from 16 percent in Italy to 58 percent in the russian Federation, with the United States at 42 percent ( figure  19). The percentage in the United States was higher than in England and Italy, but lower than in the russian Federation. At eighth grade, the percentage of students whose teachers reported participating in professional development in science content ranged from 24 percent in Italy to 82 percent in the United States. The United States had a greater percentage of students whose science teachers reported participating in this area of professional development than in all other participating G-8 countries. A higher percentage of U.S. eighth-graders had science teachers who reported participating in professional development in science content than in any of the other professional development areas. The percentage of fourth-graders whose teachers reported participating in professional development in science pedagogy/ instruction ranged from 10 percent in Italy to 62 percent in the russian Federation, with the United States at 29 percent. At eighth grade, the percentage of students whose science teachers reported participating in professional development in this area ranged from 28 percent in Italy to 84 percent in Scotland, with the United States at 64 percent. At fourth grade in Japan and at both fourth and eighth grades in England, the russian Federation, and Scotland, a greater percentage of students had teachers who reported participating in professional development in science pedagogy/instruction than their U.S. peers. The percentage of students whose teachers reported participating in professional development in science on improving students' critical thinking or problem-solving skills ranged from 11 percent in Japan to 47 percent in Scotland at fourth grade and 10 percent in Italy to 73 percent in the United States at eighth grade. Thirty-six percent of U.S. fourth-graders had teachers who reported participating in this area of professional development, higher than in Germany, Italy, and Japan, but lower than in Scotland.

(PISA 2006), this indicator presents school principals' reports of ways in which summative achievement data (i.e., not student-level data) were used in their schools. Principals of 15-yearold students were given a list of five possible ways that school achievement data could be used and asked whether each one was used. In 2006, at least 90 percent of 15-year-old students in the United States and the United Kingdom had principals who reported that school achievement data were posted publicly (e.g., in the media) ( figure 20).

In this indicator, two measures are used to compare countries' investment in education: (1) expenditure per student (expressed in absolute terms) from both public and private sources and 2total expenditure as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP). The latter measure allows a comparison of countries' expenditure relative to their presumed ability to financially support education. In 2005, expenditure per student for the United States was about $9,800 at the combined primary and secondary education levels and about $24,400 at the higher education level (figure 23a). Both figures were higher than those in the five other G-8 countries reporting data, which ranged from about $6,900 in Germany and the United Kingdom to $7,500 in France at the combined primary and secondary levels and from about $8,000 in Italy to $13,500 in the United Kingdom at the higher education level. In 2005, all the countries spent more money (i.e., in total dollars as a percentage of GDP) at the combined primary and secondary education levels than at the higher education level, where the student enrollment is much lower (figure 23b). France spent 4.0 percent of its GDP on primary and secondary education, higher than the percentage of GDP spent on education at this level than all other reporting G-8 countries.

Among 25-to 34-year-olds, more females than males had completed higher education in every G-8 country except Germany, where there was no difference. This indicator compares the highest levels of education attained by 25-to 64-year-olds in 2006 and also examines rates of young adult (ages 25 to 34) completion of higher education by sex. results for 25-to 64-year-olds were analyzed at three levels of educational attainment: lower secondary education or below, upper secondary education, 26 and higher education. Italy was the only G-8 country in which the largest percentage (48 percent) of 25-to 64-year-olds had completed lower secondary education or below as their highest level of educational attainment (figure 24a). In half of the G-8 countries (France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States), the largest percentage of 25-to 64-year-olds had completed upper secondary education as their highest level of education. In the russian Federation and Canada, the largest percentage of 25-to 64-year-olds had completed higher education (54 and 47 percent, respectively). In all G-8 countries except the russian Federation, less than half of 25-to 64-year-olds had completed higher education, with percentages ranging from 13 percent in Italy to 47 percent in Canada. In the United States, 39 percent of 25-to 64-year-olds had completed higher education. Compared to 25-to 64-year-olds, larger percentages of the subgroup of young adults (ages 25 to 34) had completed higher education in most of the G-8 countries. For example, in Canada and Japan, more than half of 25-to 34-year-olds had completed higher education, compared with 47 and 40 percent, respectively, of 25-to 64-year-olds (figures 24a and 24b). In France, 41 percent of 25-to 34-year-olds had completed higher education, compared with 26 percent of 25-to 64-year-olds. In the United States, both age groups had the same percentage of higher education completion in 2006 (39 percent). In the United States, more bachelor's degrees have been awarded to women than to men since about the early 1980s (U.S. Department of Education 2008). Among 25-to 34-year-olds in the United States in 2006, about 36 percent of males and 43 percent of females had completed higher education (figure 24b). More 25-to 34-year-old females than males had completed higher education in every G-8 country except Germany, where there was no measurable difference. The largest differences by sex were reported in Canada, the russian Federation, and France (14, 12, and 10 percentage points, respectively). Among 25-to 34-year-olds in the G-8 countries, differences favoring females in higher education completion were generally more consistent and pronounced in 2006 compared to 5 years prior. For example, in 2001, slightly more 25-to 34-year-old males than females in the United Kingdom and Germany had completed higher education (a difference of 1 and 3 percentage points, respectively) (OECD 2003). In 2001, higher education completion in Italy, Japan, and France differed in favor of females by 3 to 5 percentage points; in 2006, these differences ranged from 6 to 10 percentage points (figure 24b).\"\n",

Programs that prepare students for advanced research and highly qualified professions are called first university degree programs. First university degree programs vary in duration in different countries in different programs of study. In the United States, this corresponds to a bachelor's degree but excludes associate's degrees. This indicator compares the percentage of first degrees awarded in four major fields of study: social sciences, business, and law; science, mathematics, and engineering; the arts and humanities; and education. In 2006, a greater percentage of first university degrees were awarded in the field of social sciences, business, and law than in any other field in all G-8 countries (figure 25). The russian Federation awarded the highest percentage of first university degrees in this combined field (50 percent), which exceeded that awarded in the other major fields in total-arts and humanities; science, mathematics, and engineering; and education (41 percent). In the other G-8 countries, the percentage of first university degrees awarded in the combined field of social sciences, business, and law ranged from 28 percent in Germany to 42 percent in the United States. In science, mathematics, and engineering-related fields, the United States awarded among the lowest percentages of first university degrees of all the G-8 countries. Sixteen percent of first university degrees in the United States and 17 percent of first university degrees in Canada were awarded in science, mathematics, and engineering-related fields. In the other G-8 countries, the percentages ranged from 20 percent in Japan to 27 percent in Germany. The United States was the only G-8 country to award more first university degrees in the arts and humanities than in science, mathematics, and engineering. In 2006, about 19 percent of first university degrees were awarded to U.S. graduates in arts and humanities (compared to 16 percent in science, mathematics, and engineering). The russian Federation awarded the lowest percentage of first university degrees in the arts and humanities (4 percent); in the other G-8 countries, the percentages ranged from 15 percent in Canada and Italy to 22 percent in Germany. The smallest percentage of first university degrees was awarded in the field of education in all G-8 countries except the russian Federation. The russian Federation was the only G-8 country to award more first university degrees in education than in the arts and humanities (12 vs. 4 percent). Canada awarded the highest percentage of first university degrees in education (13 percent), while France and the United Kingdom awarded the lowest percentages in this field (both at 4 percent). The United States fell within this range, awarding 7 percent of first university degrees in education.\\nAcademic higher education 5 Upper secondary education 4 Lower secondary education or below 3 Lower secondary education or below 5 Academic higher education 3 Upper secondary education 4 Lower secondary education or below 5  2008).

      "        \"text\": \"The ISCED97 is a classification framework that allows for the alignment of the content of education systems using multiple classification criteria. The ISCED97 levels address the intent (e.g., to study basic subjects or prepare students for university) of each year of a particular education system, but do not indicate the depth or rigor of study in that year. Thus, the ISCED97 is useful when comparing the age range of students in upper secondary schools across nations; however, it does not indicate whether the curriculum and standards are equivalent within the same year of schooling across nations. The ISCED97 allows researchers to compile statistics on education internationally. The ISCED97 levels are as follows: ISCED97 level 0 is classified as preprimary education. This is \\u2022 defined as the initial stage of organized instruction, designed primarily to introduce very young children to a school-type environment. ISCED97 level 0 programs can either be center or school based. Preschool and kindergarten programs in the United States fall into the level 0 category, although kindergarten is typically considered an elementary grade in the United States. ISCED97 level 1 consists of primary education, which usually \\u2022 lasts 4 to 6 years. ISCED97 level 1 typically begins between ages 5 and 7, and is the stage where students begin to study basic subjects, such as reading, writing, and mathematics. There are differences within the education systems of some G-8 countries because responsibilities and oversight for education take place at the regional or local level. However, the charts and accompanying text in this appendix are intended to give the reader a general overview of the education system of each G-8 country, from the preprimary to the doctoral level. As indicated in the source note for each country chart, the information summarizing each country's education system comes largely from the previous Comparative Indicators report (2006). However, some modifications were made based on updated online resources and comments received from international reviewers. The reader is encouraged to seek out additional resources to gain a fuller and deeper understanding of each country's education system.

The charts are not intended to show all possible pathways that a student can take or the many configurations of grades that may be found within the same school. rather, each chart is intended to provide a general description that is useful for comparison across the G-8 countries. The colors on each chart correspond to ISCED97 levels (see next section). The ISCED97 term for each level of education is written within each block. The terms in italics in each block are a country's designation for that particular level (e.g., high school for upper secondary school). The left side of each chart is labeled with the typical ages corresponding to each level of education. The age labels represent the typical age at which a student begins the corresponding year of schooling; often, students are 1 year older at the end of the school year. Ages in bold text are the ages at which enrollment is universal, defined here as an enrollment rate of more than 90 percent. The rectangular box encasing some ages further schooling, or the labor force. Senior high school (grades 10 through 12) is considered level 3 in the United States. ISCED97 level 4 programs consist of postsecondary nontertiary \\u2022 programs. Postsecondary nontertiary programs are primarily vocational and are taken after the completion of secondary school, though the content is not more advanced than the content of secondary school courses. Although not included in the charts, postsecondary nontertiary programs are described in the text. ISCED97 level 4 programs in the United States are often in the form of 1-year certificate programs. Tertiary programs \\u2022 29 are divided into ISCED97 levels 5A, 5B, and 6. ISCED97 level 5A refers to academic higher education below the doctoral level. Level 5A programs are intended to provide sufficient qualifications to gain entry into advanced research programs and professions with high skill requirements. The international classification includes programs of medium length that last less than 5 years and long programs that last 5 to 7 years. In the United States, bachelor's, master's, and first professional degree programs are classified as ISCED97 level 5A. ISCED97 level 5B refers to vocational higher education. Level 5B programs provide a higher level of career and technical education and are designed to prepare students for the labor market. In the international classification, these programs last 2 to 4 years. In the United States, associate's degree programs are classified at this level. ISCED97 level 6 refers to the doctoral level of academic higher education. Level 6 programs usually require the completion of a research thesis or dissertation.\"\n",

The General Certificate of Education (GCE) Advanced levels (A levels) and the GCE Advanced Subsidiary examinations (AS levels) are similar tests taken in the sixth form (described below). NOTE: After the first 2 years of upper secondary school, students take General Certificate of Secondary Education qualifications (GCSEs), typically at age 16. They then have the option of continuing school for 2 years, often called the sixth form. Some schools do not offer the sixth form, in which case students can transfer to a sixth form college (which is similar but in a separate school) or go to a further education college. Sixth forms usually offer General Certificate of Education Advanced Subsidiary qualifications (GCE AS levels) at age 17 and General Certificate of Education Advanced level examinations (GCE A levels) at age 18. GCE A levels are usually required for entry to higher education. An increasing range of GCSEs, A levels, and AS levels in applied (vocational) subjects is also being offered, along with a developing range of 14-19 Diplomas. Such 14-19 Diplomas involve part-time or fulltime programs that combine vocational and academic studies in broad subject areas. They are suitable for 16-to 19-year-old adult learners or upper secondary students. Students are increasingly able to enter higher education with these parallel GCSE, A level, AS level, and 14-19 Diploma vocational qualifications.

      "[{'section_title': 'INTRODUCTION', 'text': \"Cape Hatteras National Seashore (CAHA), located along the Outer Banks, was established in 1937 to preserve cultural and natural resources of national significance. This is challenging task as this area is renowned for dynamics associated with storms and sea-level rise, including high erosion and storm surges. The enabling legislation for the CAHA as well as the Code of Federal Regulations 36 CFR parts 1-199 and the Park Compendium provide specific instructions and guidance on how the park can be managed by the National Park Service (NPS 2016). The focus of this project was vulnerability assessment of historic structures, some of which have already been relocated as a result of inundation and shifting shorelines. The project used a multi-hazard framework approach to sea level rise threats, includingshoreline change, inundation and storm surges, and scenario uncertainty. In addition, the spatial context of these hazards necessitated the consideration of planning horizons, surrounding jurisdictions and the potential for tipping points in physical vulnerability as relative sea level rises. The project also conducted a detailed documentation of data processing and analytical protocols, so as to promote replicability and future repeatability in CAHA or other NPS sites. The CAHA shares boundaries with federal, state, and local properties including that of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the North Carolina Division of Transportation (NCDOT), and Dare and Hyde counties. The establishment of these jurisdictions has influenced where coastal development has occurred as well as the regulations that have guided activities throughout the region. Although the type and level of management vary among the jurisdictions, all of the coastal development that currently exists either within or adjacent to the CAHA is potentially subject to impacts from multiple hazards. Therefore, it is important to implement effective hazard mitigation planning in order to reduce both the short-and longterm risks that hazards pose to the park cultural resources. Recognizing the vulnerability of historic structures, the NPS and East Carolina University entered this task agreement to assist park managers with long-term planning. Utilizing Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and available data and common analysis methodologies, the susceptibility of 27 historical structures to coastal erosion, storm surge, and sea level rise was evaluated. Results of the study provide park managers with susceptibility metrics for each structure as well as estimated timelines for potential impacts. Such risk assessment gives invaluable information that can be used to later identify possible mitigation needs and adaptation measures and aid future budget planning efforts. In addition, the assessment gives a useful context to broader community vulnerability and coastal development located in adjacent areas of the Outer Banks. Coastal erosion in particular regions has increased the vulnerability of some properties to coastal storm damage and left others as uninhabitable. Projections of sea level rise help indicate the enhanced susceptibility of property to coastal hazards. Even more concerning is that the access to the island by tourists and residents is largely determined by NC Highway 12. Transportation along this critical roadway has been interrupted on many occasions following hurricanes (Isabel (2003), Irene (2011) and Sandy (2012)) as well as nor'easters. The management and maintenance of this transportation corridor has been complicated by differing stakeholder interests, including those of federal and state agencies as well as local citizens. Prior directly relevant assessments of sea level rise include Titus and Wang (2008) and the NC Sea Level Rise Risk Management Study (SLRRMS). Titus and Wang (2008) implemented an analysis of regional vulnerability, although this was conducted at a coarse, regional scale. The NC SLRRMS study sought to evaluate flood zones and potential damage from flood event, and as such focused on modeling floodplains. Neither study undertook the integration of multiple hazard vulnerabilities or used the fine spatial resolution to focus on non-floodplain historic sites and structures. Nonetheless, both provide valuable context. Some other studies informed this work. The NC SLRRMS assimilated known data sources and process rate measurements for a pilot study on the Outer Banks to verify robustness of inundation modeling methodology. This pilot study focused on the Outer Banks and mainland Dare County, specifically on Pea Island. The thesis by Gore (2012) assessed the error, uncertainty, and sensitivity of the Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM) used in the methodology of the SLRRMS study. Along with erosion rates from long-term shoreline mapping by the NC Division of Coastal Management and several studies evaluating the subsidence and relative sea level across the region, these prior studies provided data and a process-based foundation for the vulnerability assessment herein.\"}, {'section_title': 'STUDY AREA', 'text': 'The boundary of the CAHA was used as the extent of this study area (Figure 1). The Seashore is bounded by \"Whalebone Junction\" in Nags Head, where U.S. 264 intersects with N.C. 12, and continues south including Hatteras Island and Ocracoke Island. Hatteras Island is the longest barrier island (~80 km) in the chain that is commonly referred to as the Outer Banks. This barrier-island system separates the Atlantic Ocean from the expansive estuaries of the Albemarle-Pamlico Estuarine System (APES). The width of Hatteras Island north of Cape Hatteras varies from ~1.2 km south of Salvo to less than one-tenth of a kilometer, just north of Buxton. A nourishment project is currently planned for 2017 in this area. The communities of Buxton and Frisco are located along the estuarine side stretching for approximately 11 km. Here the island has its maximum width of ~6 km from Cape Point to the sound. The island narrows to less than 150 m before widening to nearly two kilometers where the community of Hatteras is located before the island terminus at Hatteras Inlet. Ocracoke Island is located on the southern side of the Hatteras Inlet and extends for ~26 km; Island widths range from ~180 m to ~2.8 km where Ocracoke Village is located. Diamond Shoals is the submerged sandy shoal that extends from Cape Hatteras to the shelf edge, nearly 16 km. This and other treacherous shoals along the NC coast have yielded countless shipwrecks, giving the infamous \"Graveyard of the Atlantic\" name to the region. Diamond Shoals also divides the coastal ocean waters into two embayments known as Hatteras Bay to the north and Raleigh Bay to the south. As Riggs (2011) notes, the near-perpendicular bend of Hatteras Island causes waves, winds and currents to often impact the coast differently along the two sides of Cape Hatteras, and this must be remembered as hazard impacts are considered.'}, {'section_title': 'MULTI-HAZARD VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY', 'text': ''}, {'section_title': 'Sea Level Rise Inundation', 'text': 'Based on a dialogue with the NPS, this project focused on sea-level rise and related hazards in the next 50 years. This section reviews the overall multi-hazard approach in series and combination, and describes the scenarios adopted and outlines the reporting output and structure. First, a timeframe was chosen so as to provide a long-range view. With the moderate (50-year) time frame, it was believed to to be reasonable to employ morphostatic scenarios (i.e., inundation use of static rather than dynamic landform changes that would reflect feedbacks and future changes of landforms). Such \"morphdynamic\" modeling is complex and difficult for this coupled human-natural system and barrier spit and cape complexes Allen et al. 2012). Analyses were consistent with prior SLR vulnerability assessments in North Carolina, notably the NCSLRRMS and its sea-level-rise scenarios of 20 cm, 40 cm, 70 cm, 100 cm and 140 cm. These rise amounts are also aligned with the 2009-2010 NC Science Panel of the Coastal Resources Commission. Within the region and its relative SLR rate of 3.5-4.5 mm/yr, these scenarios provide assessment across a range of uncertainty in sea-level rise, which may include changes related to many local and ocean factors. Also, the higher rise amounts (e.g., 100-and 140 cm) may also be used to assess the possible effects of faster acceleration over a shorter time scale (NC CRC Science Panel 2010). An important consideration involving coastal elevation data quality also influenced this study. At the outset of the project, only the first generation of remotely sensed airborne elevation data were available. New elevation data obtained in 2015 from the NC Floodplain Mapping Program provided significant improvement in vertical accuracy and spatial resolution over prior data. Data quality was limited to nominal root mean square error of approximately 30 cm +/-vertical accuracy. This level of accuracy would constrain, largely preclude, consideration of inundation for near-term sea level rise of values <= 20-40 cm height, overestimating inundation extent. In order to maximize the quality of the assessment, the project timeframe was extended to use the latest elevation data from NC Floodplain Mapping. The new \"QL2\" quality data provided a significant improvement in the vertical accuracy of DEMs (<10 cm RMSE and up to 14 LiDAR points per square meter), resulting in more reliable and finer resolution of potential inundation maps. In addition, these LiDAR DEMs included improved hydro-correction (reflecting artificial drainages, culverts and conduits, and flow paths), characterization of finer-scale topographic features (e.g., dune and beach berm crests and swales) and also reduced error in adjoining marshes and dense foliage such as maritime forests and hammocks. A first-order estimate of seal level rise and potential inundation can be derived by \"bathtub\" inundation maps. Utilizing widely adopted inundation modeling techniques, NOAA\\'s Office for Coastal Management produced an online Sea Level Rise Viewer (NOAA 2016) and provides a variety of ancillary GIS data and visualizations. A core product includes raster grids of potential 1ft, 2ft, and 3ft sea level inundation. The viewer is a tool that uses nationally consistent LiDAR elevation data sets and datum analyses to evaluate the broad-scale impacts of sea level rise for long-term planning. Data and maps provided can be used at several scales to help gauge trends and prioritize actions for different scenarios. The NOAA OCM SLR Viewer provides sea level rise inundation maps for 1ft, 2ft, and 3ft above current Mean Higher High Water (MHHW). These data tiles were obtained down to Level ID 11 (~1:18,055) and overlaid onto an ESRI orthophoto basemaps and CAHA building footprints. Each historic district was mapped into a layout at 1:5000 scale for intercomparison. Below, each of the CAHA historic districts is presented in visual format using ArcGIS and the downloaded NOAA SLR inundation grids. Other grid products include potential marsh responses and uncertainty flags.   '}, {'section_title': 'Relative Vulnerability', 'text': \"Figures 2-5 depict a consistent portrayal of potential static sea level rise. Although only a first-order estimate that does not account for marsh migration and accretion, landform evolution, or human impacts  from alteration of beach, backbarrier, or engineering structures, the maps fundamentally show the elevation-area relationship. Low, backbarrier island areas lacking sediment delivery to marshes or narrow estuarine beaches are vulnerable to marsh erosion and fragmentation, and eventually, regular tidal or wind tide inundation. Concise inferences denoted in each figure caption only partially capture the site and situation context of each historic district and structures within. Bodie Island, for instance, has been known to flood in recent tropical and extratropical storms owing to the large estuarine fetch (Hurricane Irene, in particular.) The 1-2ft inundation grids derived already show the site predisposed to flooding at low levels. As relative sea level reaches 1-2ft, the marshes and adjoining roads surrounding Bodie Island Light will be impacted by frequent recurrent flooding during spring tides. In addition, flooding will occur more regularly even with lower intensity levels of extratropical and tropical storms. Little Kinnakeet is similarly more affected in the proximal areas of the backbarrier marshes and low-lying swales. Some of the adjoining roadway of Hwy 12 becomes affected (barring engineering interventions) as soon as 1-2ft of SLR. By contrast, the Hatteras Lighthouse and historic structures are distant from flooding sources with SLR, themselves sited at elevations above the reach, directly, of rising sea level. Nonetheless, there may be ancillary effects of elevated ground water tables on rainfall runoff affecting the transportation and accessibility of these sites. A focus of future study may explore these relationships to inform planning for these areas. The Hatteras Weather Bureau, while situated in a backbarrier location, is surrounded by various creeks occupying former inlet and beach ridge/spot complexes. These low-lying areas and adjoining streets provide conduits for potential floodwaters to affect access to the Weather Bureau. Finally, Ocracoke Island Lighthouse is also in a moderately vulnerable situation with 2-3ft of sea level rise owing to surrounding parcels' low elevation. The preceding maps convey first-order estimates of potential SLR inundation, yet they do not capture certain coastal hazards that may be amplified in risk as well as impacts. Storm surges, in particular, will be superimposed upon future sea level rise. Sections 3.2 and 4.0 convey the vulnerability of historic structures to storm surges and combination of surges with future sea level rise, respectively.\"}, {'section_title': 'Historical Shoreline Change', 'text': 'Shoreline change can be evaluated across a range of time and space scales, short-to long-term. For example, List et al., (2006) demonstrated how shoreline erosion may be very short-lived. The purpose of the historical shoreline change assessment was to analyze the chronic (long-term) trends associated with cross-and long-shore sediment transport in the study area. Historical shoreline changes reflect the longterm sediment budget of the shore and its net movement, including overall barrier island retreat and other morphodynamics. Shoreline change is critical to not only the direct threat to structures near the beach, but also to transportation including visitor and resident vehicular access and egress. Among the limitations of shoreline change analysis, historical shoreline data do not include vertical elevation changes, and are often mapped using the wet-dry line or wrack baselines, and thus the character of adjoining dunes (dune crest, volume, width) and beach is not assessed (nor is it available for most historical periods prior to LiDAR or aerial orthophotography). Nonetheless, historical shoreline change analysis provides a fundamental measure of the long-term evolution and can induce damage to historic structures (this is why the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse was moved in 1999; c.f., https://www.nps.gov/caha/learn/historyculture/movingthelighthouse.htm).'}, {'section_title': 'Methods', 'text': 'Historical shoreline shapefiles were obtained from the NCDCM) for the following years: 1946, 1980, 1997, 1998, 2004, and 2009 (Table 1). The USGS Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) version 4.3.4730 was used to calculate and display rate-of-change statistics in ArcMap. This involved: (1) constructing a baseline seaward of and parallel to the shorelines that were used in the measurement; (2) generating transects that were spaced 50 m apart; and (3) performing statistical computations in DSAS to produce a linear regression rate (LRR) of shoreline change along each transect as well as determine the shoreline change envelope (SCE) ( Figure 7). The LRR rate-of-change statistic is determined by fitting a least-squares regression line to all shoreline points for a particular transect, and the LRR is the slope of the line (Theiler et al., 2009). The SCE is the line segment between the shoreline farthest from and closest to the baseline at each transect. Mapping all segments represents the maximum area of change from shoreline movement for all available shoreline positions regardless of their dates (Theiler et al. 2009). The statistics were calculated with a 90% confidence interval, which means that the true rate of shoreline change falls within the range defined by the reported value plus or minus the error value. The variability around the trend reflects both mapping and measurement errors. \\nThere are three modeling approaches that can be used to estimate storm surge: the deterministic, probabilistic, or the composite (NHC 2016). The deterministic approach performs a single simulation based on a hurricane forecast. The probabilistic approach, for example P-Surge, performs ensemble model runs based on forecast error. The composite approach actually has two variants, the Maximum Envelope of Water (MEOW) and the Maximum of the MEOWs (MOMs), \"which are regarded by the NHC as the best approach for determining storm surge vulnerability for an area since it takes into account forecast uncertainty\" (National Hurricane Center, 2015). In other words, MEOW and MOM simulations allow for uncertainty in forecast tracks and landfall. These output allow for a wider regional assessment of a given scenario of a hurricane category, rather than using a single track or historical scenario which would focus impacts at local scales. The SLOSH MEOWs are a composite product that is produced from thousands of model runs with the same category, forward speed, storm trajectory, and initial tide level. The track of each model run is shifted some distance to the right or left of the main track to account for uncertainty and the maximum value that is calculated for a particular grid cell is assigned (NHC 2016). The SLOSH MOMs provide a worst case scenario product as they are compiled based on the maximum storm surge height for all hurricanes of a given category regardless of forward speed, storm trajectory, or landfall location. Since the purpose of this assessment was to identify the vulnerability of the region to storm surge, and previous studies (Barnes, J., 2013;Clinch et al., 2012;Mulligan et al., 2014;Riggs, 2011;Sheng et al., 2010) illustrated the variability of storm surge as well as the geomorphic response to different storm events, the scenarios selected included the (MOMs) for Category 1 -5 storms occurring at high tide in order to identify the development that is the most vulnerable and use a worst case scenario to assist with prioritizing mitigation actions (Allen et al., 2013). Accurate and recent topographic and bathymetric data is a critical component to mapping potential inundation caused by storm surge. Fortunately, the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration\\'s National Geodetic Survey Remote Sensing Division collected Quality Level 2 LiDAR data in 2014 for the North Carolina Floodplain Mapping program using a Riegl VQ820G system. The bare earth LiDAR that was produced from that mission was obtained through the North Carolina Emergency Management Spatial Data Download portal (rmp.nc.gov/sdd/) for the extent of the study area as individual tiles containing LAS files (an industry standard binary format for storing LiDAR data). LAS Dataset (Data Management) in ArcGIS 10.2 was used to create a mosaic all the tiles covering the study area. LAS Dataset to Raster was then used to create an elevation surface. The QL2 LiDAR had a point spacing of approximately 2 points per meter with a horizontal accuracy of 1.0 m root-mean-square error (RMSE) and vertical accuracy of 0.245 m RMSEz. These data allowed for the creation of a 1.5 meter resolution DEM using Natural Neighbor interpolation as the void filling method. A polygon delineating areas of water for the region was obtained through the National Hydrography Dataset and used to clip the extent of the DEM from the 2014 QL2 bare earth LiDAR. The resultant DEM was then used for the storm surge inundation mapping.'}, {'section_title': 'Regional Results', 'text': 'The results were first analyzed to determine the percentage of transects that exhibited a historical shoreline change rate that was either erosional or accretional. Across the Outer Banks, nearly three quarters of the oceanfront shoreline of the study area exhibited an erosional trend; 72% of transects had a LRR < 0 m/yr. The results were then further subdivided for display purposes on the historical shoreline change maps (Table 2).'}, {'section_title': 'Shoreline Change Envelope (SCE)', 'text': 'SCE is the calculated distance between the closes and farthest baseline along a transect in DSAS.

EPR only requires two shorelines and provides a simple computation. However, EPR may ignore changes in shoreline movement through the intervening period (e.g., accelerationg erosion or accretion, or cycles) (Crowell et al. 1997;Dolan et al. 1991.)

LRR is the slope of the line. The method includes all data available (not just oldest-newest as in EPR or NSM), is purely computational, and is easily implemented. The LRR technique is susceptible to error, nonetheless and inhomogeneity of variances. Individual shoreline dates may skew the estimate (detectable with residuals), and the method has a documented tendency to be a conservative estimate of change relative to EPR (Dolan et al. 1991;Genz et al. 2007.) Figure 7. Shoreline change measurement techniques employed using USGS DSAS. LRR was used for detailed analysis. Owing to concerns over the accuracy of the oldest t-sheet charts, these 1800s maps were not used to estimate the LRR rate of change. (Summaries adapted from USGS DSAS 6.) Several regions within the study area have exhibited long-term ocean shoreline erosion, including: in southern Nags Head, north of Bonner Bridge; portions of Pea Island National Wildlife Refuge including the area north of Rodanthe (locally known as \"S -Curves\"); much of the Village of Rodanthe; south of Avon until Hatteras Point; the Hatteras Inlet Hazard Area (continues onto Ocracoke Island); and the Ocracoke Inlet Hazard Area (Figure 8). This shoreline change assessment helped identify erosional hotspots in relation to the location of the historical districts.  (Figure 9). Linear regression rate (LRR) was chosen as the preferred method for analysis since it is statistically robust, quantitative method when a limited number of shorelines are available. LRR is also commonly applied for expressing shoreline movement and estimating rates of change ( Figure 5). Conducting the analysis with more recent shorelines derived from LiDAR should not only give additional temporal and spatial data but also can inform associated morphological changes. It must be recognized that many factors are driving shoreline changes including natural (e.g., storm-driven overwash and longshore transport) as well as anthropogenic activities (e.g., nourishments). To understand past and future changes requires knowledge of beach replenishments, lagged effects from alongshore pulses of erosion updrift, inlet opening and and other processes that modify the sediment budget (Inman and Dolan, 1989). Moreover, the geologic framework and regional-scale morphology may be important in controlling spatial and temporal changes in erosion.'}, {'section_title': 'Category', 'text': 'Shoreline  '}, {'section_title': 'Erosion Results and Discussion', 'text': 'Even though the oceanfront shorelines near most of the Historic Districts are exhibiting a long-term erosional trend, the current locations of these structures may still provide adaptive capacity (e.g., relocation or raising freeboard elevation) from sea-level rise. Future studies should consider more detailed, site-specific assessments that also factor in back-barrier estuarine shoreline movement as well as simulated sea-level and storm event scenarios to evaluate coastal vulnerability of these cultural resources. Limitations of this assessment include a paucity of finer temporal scale interannual change data and a purely empirical approach oriented to long-term trends. Recent storm-and human-cause modifications updrift and localized along Pea Island (e.g., the nourishment north of Rodanthe in 2015), Hatteras, and Ocracoke coastal compartments could impart short-and long-term changes with lag effects in shoreline response. In addition, the stability of Pea Island section of Highway 12 has been recently dependent upon almost continual engineering activity, and policies adopted and actions taken now and over the next decade or two (e.g., bridge construction) could have measurable along-shore consequences for sediment supply and thus shoreline, beach and dune morphology across the study area. Relative to potential SLR inundation and surges (discussed later) no CAHA sites exhibit a severe, immediate risk to oceanfront erosion. This result certainly includes significant risk reduction resulting from the relocation of the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse and associated quarters. Nonetheless, long-term rates of erosion are predominantly erosional with a high confidence of continued landward recession of the shorezone. Table 3 summarizes the rates and projects these linearly at 10, 25, and 50yr periods in the future from 2009. Figures 11-13 also depict the spatial proximity of each historic site to the oceanfront. Although no sites are directly impacted by shoreline erosion within these periods, the CG site at Bodie Island and the Ranger site at Cape Hatteras show the greatest increase in risk owing to oceanfront erosion. As the shoreline approaches these structures, other chronic and nuisance impacts may be expected to concomitantly increase (e.g., salt spray and wind) as windward landforms and vegetation degrade. Since the Hatteras Weather Bureau and Ocracoke Island occupy backbarrier and sheltered locations, these sites were not analyzed for proximity to oceanfront erosion risk, which is extremely low through the period of study.

Kinnakeet exhibits a lower rate of shoreline erosion than Bodie Island, yet backbarrier estuarine shoreline change merits consideration.'}, {'section_title': 'Site', 'text': ''}, {'section_title': 'Storm Surge Vulnerability', 'text': \"The storm surge vulnerability assessment combined downscaled storm surge simulation modeling and future sea level rise to evaluate the susceptibility of historic structures to storm impacts today and under future sea level states.

The principal data include: 1) the newest NOAA National Hurricane Center (NHC) Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH) basin models; 2) Historic Districts and specific historic structure building  Table 3. Relative risk is obviously reduced since the relocation of the lighthouse and associated quarters.

Low swales and ponds scattered at the cape may also exacerbate nuisance heavy rainfall and groundwater-induced ponding. footprints; and 3) associated shoreline and basemap information. Spatial analysis included co-registration in the horizontal (e.g., UTM earth coordinates) as well as adoption of a common vertical datum for all data (DEMs, buildings, and surges.) Storm surge modeling data was obtained from the SLOSH display program and used to map the extent and depth of inundation resulting from various storm scenarios ( Figure 6). The SLOSH model was developed by the National Weather Service's NHC to estimate storm surge from hurricanes using storm properties (e.g., track speed and direction, central pressure, and radius of maximum winds) (National Hurricane Center, 2015). The newest available SLOSH grids for the Hatteras area were obtained and coregistered to the NC LiDAR, building footprints, and other GIS datasets. We conducted a search and review of available building footprints and elevation data, including the NPS GIS databases, NC Floodplain Mapping Program, and the Dare County GIS. In 2009, the North Carolina Flood Mapping Program conducted a statewide acquisition of building footprints based on orthophotography to develop a statewide GIS layer for the purpose of vulnerability assessment, disaster mitigation, planning and flood forecasting. This effort included a program to collect first (or finished) floor elevation (FFE) data using mobile LiDAR and laser inclinometers in order to refine flood hazard assessments to the building footprint scale (NCFMP 2014). The FFE is a useful threshold to identify individual properties that are vulnerable to flooding because if the flood depth exceeds the FFE of a property, the owner may have to remediate interior and exterior damages. If the damage is severe, the property may become unusable, at least temporarily. FFE measurements were collected using various techniques under contract for NC Floodplain Mapping and FEMA (e.g., direct survey using leveling and RTK-GPS, mobile LiDAR measurement, measured and/or statistically estimated FFE above adjacent highest grades, and in some instances, measurement from the high density airborne QL2 LiDAR point clouds). NCFMP FFE data were adopted for the purpose of analysis. These data also have the benefit of well documented lineage, completeness, and currency as compared to the incomplete data sources from Dare County and NPS building data (methods undocumented, buildings incomplete, and some missing.) The objective this effort was to collect data on building elevations to analyze susceptibility to surge and SLR impacts.\"}, {'section_title': 'Surrounding Community Vulnerability', 'text': 'Mapping the storm surge inundation involved exporting the data from the SLOSH display program that contained the height of the storm surge that was modeled using the MOMs approach for the Cape Hatteras/Pamlico Sound (ht3) Basin for each category storm that occurred during high tide ( Figure 7).

The shapefile was then projected into the UTM Zone 18 North (meters) coordinate system, and the polygons were then converted to points containing the water level values. Additional fields were added to each attribute table, and the appropriate value was added to the SLOSH output to simulate the height of the storm surge that would occur under different sea level rise scenarios of 20, 40, 70, 100, and 140 cm. The Spline interpolation method was used to create a water surface based on the SLOSH point attributes at a 5-m resolution. The interpolated surface was then subtracted from the DEM using Raster Calculator. Raster Calculator was then used to create a raster of inundated areas containing values representing the depth of inundation in each cell (also known as a \"depth grid.\") This inundation mapping was completed for the entire CAHA study area and provide a baseline (along with the NOAA SLR Viewer and section 3.1) for potential exploration of adaptation and relocation strategies.

Analysis of each community provides context on how different scale events may impact the functioning of the area (and thus impact park visitation). Interestingly, , the development located in Rodanthe, Waves, and Salvo (also known as the \"Tri-Villages\") was not very vulnerable to a category 1 hurricane, only 4%, 5%, and 2% of the property within the respective communities had the potential to be inundated. However, the percentage of properties in the Tri-Villages that has the potential to be inundated jumps to over 30% for a category 2 hurricane. In contrast, the results for Ocracoke indicate that 12% of the properties are vulnerable to a category 1 hurricane, however, the percentage is drastically greater (57%) for a category 2 hurricane, the highest for all the communities. Finally, storm surge inundation produced from category 3-5 hurricanes has the potential to be severe for the entire region as the percent of properties vulnerable to inundation is greater than 47% for all of the communities.  The results of the storm surge mapping were first analyzed by the potential extent of inundation that could occur from the different category storm events as well as under different sea level rise scenarios. Based on the Storm Surge Vulnerability maps that displayed the potential extent of inundation (see appendices) it was determined that the region of the barrier island located adjacent to the Pamlico Sound is quite vulnerable to inundation beginning with a category 1 hurricane, as Hurricane Irene 2011demonstrated (Mulligan et al., 2014). The extent of potential inundation increases considerably between a category 1 and category 2 event, while the areas of potential inundation from a category 3 -5 event increase less drastically. In general, areas with an elevation of 3 meters (NAVD88) or above are the only areas that do not have the potential to be inundated by any category hurricane. Section 4 further examines whether this pattern persists with increasingly sea-level and specifically within NPS historic districts. The results of the storm surge community vulnerability assessment using the FFE of the building footprints affirm the wide extent of potential inundation. While 11% of the coastal development has the potential to be inundated by a category 1 hurricane, the number of properties that have the potential to be inundated by a category 2 hurricane is 42%, an increase of 31%. An additional 11% of properties have the potential to be inundated by a category 3 hurricane (i.e., 53%). Subsequently, an increase of 6% (59%) and 7% of structures was determined to be inundated by category 4 and 5 hurricanes, respectively. The results of the storm surge vulnerability assessment using the FFE of the building footprints illustrate that there is significant spatial variability in the vulnerability of properties; whereas the maps that display the potential extent of inundation are directly correlated with elevation.

The effect of the addition of sea level rise is logical and expected, but it is useful to evaluate over areas with low gradients and display for planning purposes. Our intent to process inundation models, surge grids and erosion rates across the extent of CAHA would incur substantial computational effort but also help identify potential areas suitable for the relocation of buildings and infrastructure and analysis of the surrounding communities in subsequent studies. Figures 15 and 16 illustrate the regional context of CAHA historic districts in relation to storm surges and future sea level rise. Across much of the region today, a category 2 storm surge of a nearby landfalling hurricane is required to inundation most areas of the Outer Banks in our modeling with SLOSH and LiDAR DEMs. In the future, even at +20cm SLR there is evident expansion of areas vulnerable to flooding by category one and two storms. However, this scale of analysis does not allow the assessment of individual buildings. These figures, it should be noted, are cartographically coarse-scale, yet the modeling was conducted at finer resolution.

Figure 18 portrays some of the underlying data, a SLOSH inundation grid superimposed on the LiDAR DEM with building centroids and footprints (inset A and B). Each building footprint and associated centroid is elevationally compared to the surge SLOSH surge category 1-4 height and the offset calculated. Structures where the surge exceeds the FFE are shown as negatives in tables 5-10. These tables provide the reference for ascertaining individual structure potential susceptibility to storm surge impact. Columns reference the SLOSH Safir-Simpson categories, and each table represents a distinct SLR scenario. The contemporary (baseline) Table 6 can then be compared to increasing risk with SLR, as in tables 6-10. Each cell of the table is color-coded to generalized categories of risk for relative comparison among surges and structures, yet consistency with time. Generally, each table portrays increasing risk, since SLR will raise the surge heights and potential impacts to structures. The following the map and tabular presentation graphics, individual district risk and overall risk are summarized in section 4.1.   At the current baseline condition without additional relative SLR, the basic vulnerability highlights structures vulnerable to storm surge inundation: \\uf0b7 At present-day (Table 5), various ancillary and infrastructure are the most vulnerable to inundation at even category 1 storm surge at Bodie Island and Ocracoke (e.g, cisterns and oil house structures). \\uf0b7 In addition, today category 2 storm surges for direct landfalling hurricanes present a slight to moderate risk of inundation to a variety of significant structures, including the visitor center and life saving stations at Bodie Island and Little Kinnakeet. \\uf0b7 Slight to moderate risk are also posed by category 2 storms today on Ocracoke, including the lighthouse, keepers quarters and shed. In tables 6-10, rising SLR presents a progression of increasing risk to structures with lower category of storm surges as SLR increases. Relative SLR of 20cm in Table 6 would be potentially realized between 2035-2055, depending on ensuing SLR. A mid-range estimate of relative SLR to reach 20cm in the CAHA region would be 2040-2045 (c.f., SLR curves of the NC CRC Science Panel (2010)). \\uf0b7 At 20cm of SLR (Table 6), the risk to several structures increases from minimal to slight for a category 1 storm, including the Bodie Island lighthouse and storehouse, Little Kinnakeet kitchen, shed and flag house at Hatteras Island. Present risks, already severe, also increase for cistems and oil house at Bodie Island. \\uf0b7 With a category 2 landfall (also Table 6), storm surge would present additional moderate risks to the Bodie Island Life Saving site structure, the visitors center, and Little Kinnakeet Boat House. These structures FFEs would be nearly 1m below the static surge height, which does not include wave action in the MOM modeling. Tables 7-10 present SLR scenarios with surges that are further out with time and/or portray a SLR acceleration. Table 8, +40cm SLR, would be potentially realized as soon as the early 2050s (translating to a 1.4m SLR rise by 2100) or as late as 2100 (using a linear projection of the last ~100yrs.) \\uf0b7 Table 8 +40cm SLR foresees an expansion of risk for category 1 surges to affect a large array of structures, including the boat house at Little Kinnakeet and shed at Hatteras Weather Bureau. \\uf0b7 Maximal Category 2 surges at +40cm SLR will also potentially elevate risks for the Ocracoke Light, keepers quarters and tool house and the Bodie Island LS&RS and Hilton CG. \\uf0b7 Category 3 surges with +40cm SLR also increase in risk severity to moderate level for Ocracoke, with surges from the MOMs predicting heights 0.68 to 0.79 meters above the FFE of these structures. Additional evaluation of Tables 8-10 is limited to discussion of the trends. These tables inherit a greater degree of uncertainty reflecting variation of eustatic SLR projections and climate models. The ranges of relative SLR in these tables cover +70cm to +140cm. These scenarios could be realized as soon as 2070 on the most aggressive SLR curve of the NC CRC Science Panel (1.4m rise by 2100). Generally, these scenarios and the timeframe are beyond the scope of work. Nonetheless, the progressive evolution of increasing risk and the potential severity illustrated in the tables is noteworthy. In addition to the site-and structure-specific tables of surge, SLR, and susceptibility of the FFEs, we include a few summary graphs that depict the evolving risk across categories of hurricane surges, percentage of structures flooded by storm surge and sea level rise height. \\uf0b7 Figure 19 illustrates that present day sea level poses only a slight relative risk to most CAHA structures. The FFEs of the structures are higher than the SLOSH MOM surges for most category 1 storms (of course, non-inclusive of superimposed wave action.) \\uf0b7 Nonetheless, with category 3 storms at current sea level, a majority of the CAHA structures are categorized as slight risk or higher (almost 50% moderate to severe) of surge heights exceeding the FFEs (Figure 19). This figure provides a baseline for overall interpretation of the surges with SLR in Figures 20 and 21. To effect risk reduction for individual and overall CAHA historic resource assets, various adaptation or mitigation options would need to be explored and implemented. The results here illustrate that there is a growing threat with sea level rise, even if current climatology of tropical storms were to remain unchanged in magnitude.

The Coastal Erosion Study (2016) also discusses mitigation activities that are currently being used throughout the State and potential strategies that should be considered in the future. Beach nourishment is the strategy that has been most commonly used along the NC coast to mitigate erosion for the purpose of protecting NC Route 12 and maintain the operation of the transportation system. Beach nourishment is an effective \"soft\" engineering alternative that does not result in some of the impacts that result from the \"hard\" engineering solutions implemented to mitigate erosion through the construction of erosion control structures like, groins, jetties, breakwaters, and seawalls. Unlike more permanent erosion control structures which attempt to inhibit natural processes that result in coastal erosion, beach nourishment acts as a buffer and wards off the threat of coastal erosion temporarily requiring periodic maintenance to preserve the effectiveness of the mitigation strategy over the longterm. A total of 33 beach nourishment episodes have occurred throughout the study area including the recently completed Mirlo Beach Nourishment project (September 2014), conducted to protect a section of NC 12, locally known as \"S-Curves\" or \"S-Turns\", north of Rodanthe. Although some of the episodes were conducted to fill areas where breaching occurred and inlets opened following extreme storm events, the majority of these episodes have occurred in the same areas that are susceptible to lower magnitude storm events and exhibit highly erosional long-term shoreline trends. For example, a low pressure weather system that tracked offshore of the Outer Banks on February 7 th , 2016, caused overwash and breaching at Mirlo Beach in Rodanthe, the oceanfront of Buxton, and along the northern portion of Ocracoke Island. Although beach nourishment reduces the vulnerability of coastal development along the oceanfront, maintaining the integrity and viability of the transportation system via N.C. 12 is the primary purpose of the projects that have been completed in the past as well as future scoped and proposed projects. NCDOT is the primary agency responsible for determining the feasibility of such projects and they have identified three sections of NC 12 south of Rodanthe in Dare and Hyde Counties that experienced overwash events in recent years and justified conducting feasibility studies as a preliminary step of the National Environmental Policy Act process to identify potential project scope, range of estimated costs of completion, and project-specific concerns related to preserving the NC 12 transportation corridor. The sections include: \\uf0b7 Buxton Canadian Hole \"Hot Spot\" o NC 12 from Avon to Buxton feasibility study was completed in December 2015 \\uf0b7 Hatteras Village \"Hot Spot\" o NC 12 Hatteras Village feasibility study was completed in February 2016 \\uf0b7 Ocracoke Island \"Hot Spot\" o Feasibility study has not yet been initiated As a result of the NC 12 from Avon to Buxton Feasibility Study (2015) and according to Dare County, the Buxton Beach Nourishment Project will be constructed in 2017 and plans to widen 4.6 kilometers of oceanfront by approximately 75 meters for an estimated $25 million, with the majority of the funding coming from the Beach Nourishment Fund. Additional funding for this project will come from the establishment of a service district and is discussed in more detail below: The majority of the historical nourishment episodes that have occurred throughout the study area as well as both the recent Mirlo Beach Nourishment project and future Buxton Beach Nourishment project use hydraulic dredging techniques to pump sand on the beach. Beach nourishment using hydraulic dredging is an effective technique to supply sand to large project areas, but it is a costly option (as indicated by the estimated cost of the Buxton Beach Nourishment Project) that requires multi-agency coordination that can take years to complete from the time the project is identified as feasible, scoped, financed, permitted, and constructed. Although Dare County has (1) exhibited effective methods for financing nourishment projects through the establishment of the Beach Nourishment Fund and service district for the Buxton Beach Nourishment Project, and (2) been able to move through the regulatory process in order to conduct the beach nourishment, the identification of suitable source material may become a limiting factor that could reduce the viability of beach nourishment as an effective method to mitigate erosion in the future. The Coastal Erosion Study (2016) identifies four major potential sand sources that could be used for future nourishment projects, but they would all require the use of hydraulic dredging techniques. Beach nourishment that uses hydraulic dredging techniques have an expensive mobilization cost and therefore are only cost effect for large scale projects. The study also mentions that nourishment projects can utilize sand trucked to the beach from an upland source. However, the use of this technique is often limited to smaller site-specific projects, and the proximity of quarries with availability material to the study area serves as another limiting factor. Regardless of the technique used the sediment must have similar characteristics as the native beach where it is being placed (15A NCAC 7H .0312) although an exemption is provided for sediment from regularly maintained navigation channels. An alternative method of beach nourishment that was not discussed in the Coastal Erosion Study (2016) uses a technique known as \"back-passing\". Sand back-passing essentially harvests sand from accretional areas and deposits sand in erosional areas using excavators, dump trucks, and bulldozers. The method efficiently manages limited sand resources by reversing the natural migration of sediment along shore and \"balances\" the sediment budget. Although, large scale beach nourishment projects are the most effective for protecting infrastructure from coastal erosion by widening the beach to increase the buffer distance to the shoreline, or constructing large scale dunes to provide storm protection; back-passing can be an effective method to prolong the need for repetitive large scale re-nourishment projects. Potential impacts with back-passing include disturbing shorebird nesting habitat or threatened plant species, or unearthing or damaging buried historical shipwrecks and cultural items (Hafner, 2012). However, these impacts can be easily avoided with strategic site selection and planning to conduct the work outside of nesting seasons. Additional impacts and costs of back-passing are associated with \"wear and tear\" on the roadway infrastructure as dump trucks haul sand from the excavation site to the deposition site. However, since the study area has a continuous linear shoreline impacts to the roadway can be avoided depending on the project scope. Successful back-passing projects have recently been completed in multiple coastal communities in New Jersey 1 and can be referenced as an example. One critical factor associated with the back-passing projects is the development of a sediment budget. The New Jersey Beach Profile Network is surveyed bi-annually by the Stockton University Coastal Research Center and the results of the survey are used to identify trends in shoreline position. Quarterly surveys are conducted in areas that have erosional concerns using more densely spaced transects providing enough information to perform volumetric calculations. The Carteret County Shore Protection Office conducts a similar beach monitoring program that could also be used as an additional reference and perhaps a more suitable model for Dare and Hyde County to follow. It is recommended that Dare and Hyde County coordinate with the National Park Service unit of Cape Hatteras National Seashore to implement a beach monitoring program to identify sediment transport trends and develop effective management strategies to mitigate coastal erosion.'}, {'section_title': 'Storm Surge Flooding', 'text': \"Coastal flooding is the hazard with the longest history of hazard mitigation planning throughout the study region, primarily through participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which is administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The NFIP provides several regulatory products that participating communities use to support hazard mitigation through effective FIRMs contain critical pieces of information that are needed to support floodplain management and hazard mitigation planning such as floodplain boundaries, flood zones, and base flood elevations (BFEs). These regulatory products are developed using state of the art methods to 1) collect topographic and bathymetric conditions; 2) extensively model flood conditions from storm events with different probabilities for areas that are subject to both riverine and/or coastal flooding; and 3) facilitate the dissemination of flood risk information to the public, stakeholders, and community officials by hosting the adopted DFIRMs (Digital FIRMs) on interactive web mapping portals, such as the NC Flood Risk Information System (FRIS) developed by the NC Department of Public Safety. Even though the coastal flood risk mapping process has been continually improved through the collaboration with various partners in other federal agencies, academia, and the private sector to more accurately determine flood risk along dynamic coastal areas; the FIRMs are primarily used to determine mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements as well as the insurance rate for properties that are mapped within a flood zone. The level of effort to collect baseline topographic and bathymetric data, perform flood modeling, and complete the map update process is immense and takes years to become finalized and adopted, especially if there are appeals. Since the FIRMs are developed as part of the NFIP, flood risk projects are completed on a rotating basis for communities throughout the country. It can take up to a decade or more for FIRMs 2 to be updated, with priority given to more densely populated areas. Therefore the level of flood risk can become inaccurate as time passes beyond the effective date of a FIRM; especially if significant geomorphic changes have occurred, or significant rates of sea level rise/land subsidence exist in the area since the most recent coastal flood risk study was completed. Several web based tools have been developed by multiple federal agencies including the US Geological Survey (USGS) and the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to evaluate risk to coastal hazards. These web based tool can supplement regulatory products such as FIRMs and improve hazard mitigation planning. The USGS has developed the Coastal Change Hazards Portal, which provides interactive web mapping capabilities and downloadable data layers to analyze coastal change science along our Nation's coast. NOAA's Office for Coastal Management has performed a sea level rise mapping project at the regional level and made the Sea Level Rise (SLR) Viewer publicly available on the web so that coastal managers and scientists can use it as a screening tool to identify areas that are most vulnerable to sea level rise and increased flooding frequency. While the Coastal Change Hazards Portal and SLR Viewer are very useful tools for planning at the regional scale, decisions are often made at the individual property scale. The purpose of the storm surge vulnerability assessment was to demonstrate a methodology that could be initiated by a GIS analyst within a government agency, whether federal, state, county or other to reevaluate the vulnerability of coastal developments as new or updated information is acquired. For example, an assessment could be performed that identifies properties that have a FFE that is below the Base Flood Elevation associated with the location of the property on the effective and/or preliminary FIRMs. The assessment could also be repeated when new elevation data is acquired from coastal mapping projects that are either collected as routine surveys or following storm events in order to determine how vulnerability to storm surge changes in the interim between the release of new FIRMs. Elevation survey data with higher accuracy may also become available and the assessment could be repeated to determine if the vulnerability of properties in the surrounding areas changes (Allen et al., 2010). For example, the assessment could be repeated once the Buxton Beach Nourishment project is completed to determine the effect the project has on reducing the vulnerability of the surrounding infrastructure. An assessment could also be performed using depth grids that take sea level rise into consideration since the Storm Surge Vulnerability maps that included sea level rise scenarios only displayed the potential extent of inundation.\"}, {'section_title': 'Engagement', 'text': 'In addition to periodic meetings and briefings between ECU faculty, students, and NPS CAHA staff, we incorporated engagement into this project to both inform the analysis as well as obtain feedback from the community and other agencies conducting similar research. At the state level, we provided presentations that included NC Floodplain Mapping Program, Albemarle-Pamlico National Estuary Partnership, and local government and geospatial and emergency management professionals. These included presentations at the NC ArcUser Group Conference and Eastern Symposium, presentations at NOAA Coastal GeoTools, APNEP Decision Support Working Group, NC Geographic Information Coordinating Council, and the NC Hurricane Workshop. Locally, Ms. Donna Creef, Planning Director for Dare County, was contacted after project student Michael Flynn was awarded a NC Sea Grant Coastal Policy Fellowship to set up a meeting to discuss the work and alignment with existing efforts by the Dare County Planning Department. An initial meeting was held February 5 th , 2016, at the Dare County Administration Building, which followed a meeting that was conducted with NPS staff to discuss progress on the cooperative agreement evaluating the vulnerability of the landmarks located within the Cape Hatteras National Seashore. Drew Pearson, Director of Emergency Management, was included and briefed on work for this CAHA project. We discussed how similar products could be developed for the communities located along the Outer Banks. These discussions resulted in participation in the Hurricane Preparedness and Safety Open House in May 2016. A planning team consisting of Drew Pearson, Donna Creef, Noah Gillam, Sara Small, Holly White, and Kevin Zorc, worked together to host not only the first, but possibly inaugural annual event. The initial event was held on Friday, May 20 th , 2016 from 3:00 to 8:00 pm at the Nags Head Fire Station 16, and a supplemental Open House was offered on Saturday, May 21 st at the Fessenden Center in Buxton to provide an opportunity for members in communities that lived in the southern Hatteras Island. The event at the Nags Head Fire Station 16 consisted of displays, activities, and guest speakers of numerous organizations that provided information that could be used by the public to improve hurricane preparedness. Mayor Edwards and Commissioner Woodard attended the event and provided opening remarks. I gave a presentation about conducting the Multi-Hazard Vulnerability Assessment before the feature presentation on storm surge was given by Jamie Rhome, Team Lead of the Storm Surge Unit of the National Hurricane Center, which was followed by a presentation on forecasts and warnings given by Richard Bandy, Meteorologist-in-Charge at the NWS Newport/Morehead City Office. Over 250 people attended the event and learned about tropical storms and hurricanes, flooding, citizen safety, mitigation construction products, and explored topics relative to the life cycle of disasterpreparedness, response, recovery, and mitigation. The attendees additionally enjoyed a cook out that was provided by the Nags Head Fire Department, and youth activities helped to make the event a truly inclusive community gathering that exemplified the best of a public/private partnership. Education and outreach is a critical component of hazard mitigation, and it is hoped that the Hurricane Preparedness and Safety Open House becomes an annual event that other communities can use as model. The event and collaboration with Dare County Planning spurred further interest and adoption of the same vulnerability assessment methodology for Outer Banks communities beyond the NPS Historic Districts.'}, {'section_title': 'CONCLUSION', 'text': 'The coastal development located along the Outer Banks and adjacent to the Cape Hatteras National Seashore is vulnerable to multiple coastal hazards including, coastal erosion, storm surge, and sea level rise. The purpose of this assessment was to determine the vulnerability of national historic landmarks to each hazard so that mitigation strategies can subsequently be developed. Results affirm the notion of increasing susceptibility to inundation and attendant coastal hazards with increasing sea level rise. This assessment also demonstrated a GIS-based methodology that can be repeated by GIS and vulnerability analysts in when updated information that was used in the assessment becomes available. The methodology is also adaptable and portable to other NPS parks and facilities and surrounding communities. Providing the public with access to this information may help to guide mitigation or adaptation strategies for individual and community property to collectively increase the resiliency of the region to multiple coastal hazards. A number of limitations are notable for this study, necessarily constraining results and recommendations. First, the study made use primarily of existing data. The investigators required the best available coastal elevations and thus awaited the delivery of NC QL2 LiDAR, which pushed the study back several months. In addition, the availability of first floor elevation data was constrained; a mix of sources were initially found with variable documentation and unknown quality and accuracy. Hence, the project adopted a complete set of data from the NCFMP program (cross-checking against this in the field by spot-checking and against the limited FFEs from NPS.) Complex analytical steps required the conversion of all GIS data to a common vertical and horizontal datum, with some limitations and error inherently introduced in such processing. We were fortuitous with the release of a new SLOSH grid for the Hatteras region by the NWS National Hurricane Center, allowing some improvement to the downscaling of MOM inundation maps. Shoreline change analyses were completed for the oceanfront, but early in the project the team did not foresee the potential need to also include estuarine shoreline change and erosion rates. The vulnerability revealed by static SLR inundation for Bodie Island and, to a lesser degree, Little Kinnakeet, are suggestive of a need for closer examination of potential estuarine shoreline impacts to historic structures or ancillary facilities and roads at these sites. Similarly, island narrowing at other areas of CAHA, e.g., the Haulover or \"Canadian Hole\", may indicate a need to analyze estuarine shorelines for changes affecting park resources. A number of insights and potential benefits of this project may also be synthesized for other NPS CAHA purposes. First, although this study focused on historic structures, there are also potential impacts of SLR to natural resources, habitats, and ecosystem services throughout CAHA. To some extent, the data acquired and modeling in this study could inform such analyses. Static SLR and SLOSH grids, LiDAR DEMs, and shoreline data, for instance, could be assimilated in models such as the Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM) to evaluate marsh fragmentation, loss, or migration up elevation. Shoreline change rates calculated in this study are an input parameter to SLAMM. The LiDAR DEMs for this project have been converted to a vertical datum that is relatively straightforward to transform for SLAMM wetland modeling (using tidal datums.) The approach taken to analyze structures across storm surge impacts and SLR levels is applicable to habitats and even recreational visitor activities (e.g., trails, kitesurfing, windsurfing, fishing, camping or ORV beach use.) In the ensuing management application of this study, a few recommendations are also suggested to monitor and further predict sea level rise impacts on the park\\'s cultural resources. The following specific tasks could improve management of these resources and any replication or follow-on study in the nearterm: \\uf0b7 Monitor the periodic reporting of sea level trends by NOAA and the NC Division of Coastal Management. o The NOAA Office for Coastal Management continues to provide the Sea Level Rise Viewer application and to support other federal, state and local agencies with trend summaries, geospatial data, and analysis tools. o Other NOAA entities such as Tides and Currents provide real-time and historic information and trends. https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/sltrends/sltrends.html o NC Division of Coastal Management coordinates the state\\'s CRC Science Panel and tracking of trends for policy. Monitoring the DCM Sea Level site and its reports will facilitate reducing uncertainty for NC area projects of sea level rise https://deq.nc.gov/about/divisions/coastal-management/coastal-management-hottopics/sea-level-rise \\uf0b7 As SLR continues opportunities to improve risk assessments may evolve. NPS should evaluate newly available data from among various agencies. o New FEMA Digital Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) in preliminary review for the Outer Banks counties will be released. FIRMs will continue to be a relevant coastal management policy device, directly and indirectly affecting land use. NPS efforts to relocate, elevate, or redesign its assets may be impacted by changes in FIRMs affecting the surrounding communities. In addition, modeling of FIRMS incorporates wave action and potential storm impacts. New FIRMs may reveal near-term changes in storm surge wave energy zones that were not available to this study. o The NC Floodplain Mapping Program has a strong record of procurement of highresolution LiDAR elevation data, a critical component to this study. Future LiDAR, building and infrastructure data integrated by NCFMP may present a strong geospatial asset to the NPS. o The NC Coastal Atlas (https://www.nccoastalatlas.org/) and NC OneMap (http://data.nconemap.gov/geoportal/catalog/main/home.page) provide useful geospatial data repositories for the NPS CAHA and other NPS units in coastal North Carolina. The Atlas recently developed an inventory of coastal recreational assets, a coastal salinity database, and a series of \"marsh migration potential\" maps that could inform NPS planning for recreation or natural resources in CAHA.'}, {'section_title': 'ACKNOWLEDGMENTS', 'text': 'The PI and co-PIs Walsh, Crawford and Montz of East Carolina University are grateful for the active cooperation of several people and entities sharing data, historical and practical knowledge, technical information and guidance to complete this study.

      "        \"text\": \"Cape Hatteras National Seashore (CAHA), located along the Outer Banks, was established in 1937 to preserve cultural and natural resources of national significance. This is challenging task as this area is renowned for dynamics associated with storms and sea-level rise, including high erosion and storm surges. The enabling legislation for the CAHA as well as the Code of Federal Regulations 36 CFR parts 1-199 and the Park Compendium provide specific instructions and guidance on how the park can be managed by the National Park Service (NPS 2016). The focus of this project was vulnerability assessment of historic structures, some of which have already been relocated as a result of inundation and shifting shorelines. The project used a multi-hazard framework approach to sea level rise threats, includingshoreline change, inundation and storm surges, and scenario uncertainty. In addition, the spatial context of these hazards necessitated the consideration of planning horizons, surrounding jurisdictions and the potential for tipping points in physical vulnerability as relative sea level rises. The project also conducted a detailed documentation of data processing and analytical protocols, so as to promote replicability and future repeatability in CAHA or other NPS sites. The CAHA shares boundaries with federal, state, and local properties including that of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the North Carolina Division of Transportation (NCDOT), and Dare and Hyde counties. The establishment of these jurisdictions has influenced where coastal development has occurred as well as the regulations that have guided activities throughout the region. Although the type and level of management vary among the jurisdictions, all of the coastal development that currently exists either within or adjacent to the CAHA is potentially subject to impacts from multiple hazards. Therefore, it is important to implement effective hazard mitigation planning in order to reduce both the short-and longterm risks that hazards pose to the park cultural resources. Recognizing the vulnerability of historic structures, the NPS and East Carolina University entered this task agreement to assist park managers with long-term planning. Utilizing Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and available data and common analysis methodologies, the susceptibility of 27 historical structures to coastal erosion, storm surge, and sea level rise was evaluated. Results of the study provide park managers with susceptibility metrics for each structure as well as estimated timelines for potential impacts. Such risk assessment gives invaluable information that can be used to later identify possible mitigation needs and adaptation measures and aid future budget planning efforts. In addition, the assessment gives a useful context to broader community vulnerability and coastal development located in adjacent areas of the Outer Banks. Coastal erosion in particular regions has increased the vulnerability of some properties to coastal storm damage and left others as uninhabitable. Projections of sea level rise help indicate the enhanced susceptibility of property to coastal hazards. Even more concerning is that the access to the island by tourists and residents is largely determined by NC Highway 12. Transportation along this critical roadway has been interrupted on many occasions following hurricanes (Isabel (2003), Irene (2011) and Sandy (2012)) as well as nor'easters. The management and maintenance of this transportation corridor has been complicated by differing stakeholder interests, including those of federal and state agencies as well as local citizens. Prior directly relevant assessments of sea level rise include Titus and Wang (2008) and the NC Sea Level Rise Risk Management Study (SLRRMS). Titus and Wang (2008) implemented an analysis of regional vulnerability, although this was conducted at a coarse, regional scale. The NC SLRRMS study sought to evaluate flood zones and potential damage from flood event, and as such focused on modeling floodplains. Neither study undertook the integration of multiple hazard vulnerabilities or used the fine spatial resolution to focus on non-floodplain historic sites and structures. Nonetheless, both provide valuable context. Some other studies informed this work. The NC SLRRMS assimilated known data sources and process rate measurements for a pilot study on the Outer Banks to verify robustness of inundation modeling methodology. This pilot study focused on the Outer Banks and mainland Dare County, specifically on Pea Island. The thesis by Gore (2012) assessed the error, uncertainty, and sensitivity of the Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM) used in the methodology of the SLRRMS study. Along with erosion rates from long-term shoreline mapping by the NC Division of Coastal Management and several studies evaluating the subsidence and relative sea level across the region, these prior studies provided data and a process-based foundation for the vulnerability assessment herein.\"\n",

      "        \"text\": \"The boundary of the CAHA was used as the extent of this study area (Figure 1). The Seashore is bounded by \\\"Whalebone Junction\\\" in Nags Head, where U.S. 264 intersects with N.C. 12, and continues south including Hatteras Island and Ocracoke Island. Hatteras Island is the longest barrier island (~80 km) in the chain that is commonly referred to as the Outer Banks. This barrier-island system separates the Atlantic Ocean from the expansive estuaries of the Albemarle-Pamlico Estuarine System (APES). The width of Hatteras Island north of Cape Hatteras varies from ~1.2 km south of Salvo to less than one-tenth of a kilometer, just north of Buxton. A nourishment project is currently planned for 2017 in this area. The communities of Buxton and Frisco are located along the estuarine side stretching for approximately 11 km. Here the island has its maximum width of ~6 km from Cape Point to the sound. The island narrows to less than 150 m before widening to nearly two kilometers where the community of Hatteras is located before the island terminus at Hatteras Inlet. Ocracoke Island is located on the southern side of the Hatteras Inlet and extends for ~26 km; Island widths range from ~180 m to ~2.8 km where Ocracoke Village is located. Diamond Shoals is the submerged sandy shoal that extends from Cape Hatteras to the shelf edge, nearly 16 km. This and other treacherous shoals along the NC coast have yielded countless shipwrecks, giving the infamous \\\"Graveyard of the Atlantic\\\" name to the region. Diamond Shoals also divides the coastal ocean waters into two embayments known as Hatteras Bay to the north and Raleigh Bay to the south. As Riggs (2011) notes, the near-perpendicular bend of Hatteras Island causes waves, winds and currents to often impact the coast differently along the two sides of Cape Hatteras, and this must be remembered as hazard impacts are considered.\"\n",

      "        \"text\": \"Based on a dialogue with the NPS, this project focused on sea-level rise and related hazards in the next 50 years. This section reviews the overall multi-hazard approach in series and combination, and describes the scenarios adopted and outlines the reporting output and structure. First, a timeframe was chosen so as to provide a long-range view. With the moderate (50-year) time frame, it was believed to to be reasonable to employ morphostatic scenarios (i.e., inundation use of static rather than dynamic landform changes that would reflect feedbacks and future changes of landforms). Such \\\"morphdynamic\\\" modeling is complex and difficult for this coupled human-natural system and barrier spit and cape complexes Allen et al. 2012). Analyses were consistent with prior SLR vulnerability assessments in North Carolina, notably the NCSLRRMS and its sea-level-rise scenarios of 20 cm, 40 cm, 70 cm, 100 cm and 140 cm. These rise amounts are also aligned with the 2009-2010 NC Science Panel of the Coastal Resources Commission. Within the region and its relative SLR rate of 3.5-4.5 mm/yr, these scenarios provide assessment across a range of uncertainty in sea-level rise, which may include changes related to many local and ocean factors. Also, the higher rise amounts (e.g., 100-and 140 cm) may also be used to assess the possible effects of faster acceleration over a shorter time scale (NC CRC Science Panel 2010). An important consideration involving coastal elevation data quality also influenced this study. At the outset of the project, only the first generation of remotely sensed airborne elevation data were available. New elevation data obtained in 2015 from the NC Floodplain Mapping Program provided significant improvement in vertical accuracy and spatial resolution over prior data. Data quality was limited to nominal root mean square error of approximately 30 cm +/-vertical accuracy. This level of accuracy would constrain, largely preclude, consideration of inundation for near-term sea level rise of values <= 20-40 cm height, overestimating inundation extent. In order to maximize the quality of the assessment, the project timeframe was extended to use the latest elevation data from NC Floodplain Mapping. The new \\\"QL2\\\" quality data provided a significant improvement in the vertical accuracy of DEMs (<10 cm RMSE and up to 14 LiDAR points per square meter), resulting in more reliable and finer resolution of potential inundation maps. In addition, these LiDAR DEMs included improved hydro-correction (reflecting artificial drainages, culverts and conduits, and flow paths), characterization of finer-scale topographic features (e.g., dune and beach berm crests and swales) and also reduced error in adjoining marshes and dense foliage such as maritime forests and hammocks. A first-order estimate of seal level rise and potential inundation can be derived by \\\"bathtub\\\" inundation maps. Utilizing widely adopted inundation modeling techniques, NOAA's Office for Coastal Management produced an online Sea Level Rise Viewer (NOAA 2016) and provides a variety of ancillary GIS data and visualizations. A core product includes raster grids of potential 1ft, 2ft, and 3ft sea level inundation. The viewer is a tool that uses nationally consistent LiDAR elevation data sets and datum analyses to evaluate the broad-scale impacts of sea level rise for long-term planning. Data and maps provided can be used at several scales to help gauge trends and prioritize actions for different scenarios. The NOAA OCM SLR Viewer provides sea level rise inundation maps for 1ft, 2ft, and 3ft above current Mean Higher High Water (MHHW). These data tiles were obtained down to Level ID 11 (~1:18,055) and overlaid onto an ESRI orthophoto basemaps and CAHA building footprints. Each historic district was mapped into a layout at 1:5000 scale for intercomparison. Below, each of the CAHA historic districts is presented in visual format using ArcGIS and the downloaded NOAA SLR inundation grids. Other grid products include potential marsh responses and uncertainty flags.   \"\n",

Although only a first-order estimate that does not account for marsh migration and accretion, landform evolution, or human impacts  from alteration of beach, backbarrier, or engineering structures, the maps fundamentally show the elevation-area relationship. Low, backbarrier island areas lacking sediment delivery to marshes or narrow estuarine beaches are vulnerable to marsh erosion and fragmentation, and eventually, regular tidal or wind tide inundation. Concise inferences denoted in each figure caption only partially capture the site and situation context of each historic district and structures within. Bodie Island, for instance, has been known to flood in recent tropical and extratropical storms owing to the large estuarine fetch (Hurricane Irene, in particular.) The 1-2ft inundation grids derived already show the site predisposed to flooding at low levels. As relative sea level reaches 1-2ft, the marshes and adjoining roads surrounding Bodie Island Light will be impacted by frequent recurrent flooding during spring tides. In addition, flooding will occur more regularly even with lower intensity levels of extratropical and tropical storms. Little Kinnakeet is similarly more affected in the proximal areas of the backbarrier marshes and low-lying swales. Some of the adjoining roadway of Hwy 12 becomes affected (barring engineering interventions) as soon as 1-2ft of SLR. By contrast, the Hatteras Lighthouse and historic structures are distant from flooding sources with SLR, themselves sited at elevations above the reach, directly, of rising sea level. Nonetheless, there may be ancillary effects of elevated ground water tables on rainfall runoff affecting the transportation and accessibility of these sites. A focus of future study may explore these relationships to inform planning for these areas. The Hatteras Weather Bureau, while situated in a backbarrier location, is surrounded by various creeks occupying former inlet and beach ridge/spot complexes. These low-lying areas and adjoining streets provide conduits for potential floodwaters to affect access to the Weather Bureau. Finally, Ocracoke Island Lighthouse is also in a moderately vulnerable situation with 2-3ft of sea level rise owing to surrounding parcels' low elevation. The preceding maps convey first-order estimates of potential SLR inundation, yet they do not capture certain coastal hazards that may be amplified in risk as well as impacts. Storm surges, in particular, will be superimposed upon future sea level rise.

For example, List et al., (2006) demonstrated how shoreline erosion may be very short-lived. The purpose of the historical shoreline change assessment was to analyze the chronic (long-term) trends associated with cross-and long-shore sediment transport in the study area. Historical shoreline changes reflect the longterm sediment budget of the shore and its net movement, including overall barrier island retreat and other morphodynamics. Shoreline change is critical to not only the direct threat to structures near the beach, but also to transportation including visitor and resident vehicular access and egress. Among the limitations of shoreline change analysis, historical shoreline data do not include vertical elevation changes, and are often mapped using the wet-dry line or wrack baselines, and thus the character of adjoining dunes (dune crest, volume, width) and beach is not assessed (nor is it available for most historical periods prior to LiDAR or aerial orthophotography). Nonetheless, historical shoreline change analysis provides a fundamental measure of the long-term evolution and can induce damage to historic structures (this is why the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse was moved in 1999; c.f., https://www.nps.gov/caha/learn/historyculture/movingthelighthouse.htm).\"\n",

The USGS Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) version 4.3.4730 was used to calculate and display rate-of-change statistics in ArcMap. This involved: (1) constructing a baseline seaward of and parallel to the shorelines that were used in the measurement; (2) generating transects that were spaced 50 m apart; and (3) performing statistical computations in DSAS to produce a linear regression rate (LRR) of shoreline change along each transect as well as determine the shoreline change envelope (SCE) ( Figure 7). The LRR rate-of-change statistic is determined by fitting a least-squares regression line to all shoreline points for a particular transect, and the LRR is the slope of the line (Theiler et al., 2009). The SCE is the line segment between the shoreline farthest from and closest to the baseline at each transect. Mapping all segments represents the maximum area of change from shoreline movement for all available shoreline positions regardless of their dates (Theiler et al. 2009). The statistics were calculated with a 90% confidence interval, which means that the true rate of shoreline change falls within the range defined by the reported value plus or minus the error value. The variability around the trend reflects both mapping and measurement errors. \\nThere are three modeling approaches that can be used to estimate storm surge: the deterministic, probabilistic, or the composite (NHC 2016). The deterministic approach performs a single simulation based on a hurricane forecast. The probabilistic approach, for example P-Surge, performs ensemble model runs based on forecast error. The composite approach actually has two variants, the Maximum Envelope of Water (MEOW) and the Maximum of the MEOWs (MOMs), \\\"which are regarded by the NHC as the best approach for determining storm surge vulnerability for an area since it takes into account forecast uncertainty\\\" (National Hurricane Center, 2015). In other words, MEOW and MOM simulations allow for uncertainty in forecast tracks and landfall. These output allow for a wider regional assessment of a given scenario of a hurricane category, rather than using a single track or historical scenario which would focus impacts at local scales. The SLOSH MEOWs are a composite product that is produced from thousands of model runs with the same category, forward speed, storm trajectory, and initial tide level. The track of each model run is shifted some distance to the right or left of the main track to account for uncertainty and the maximum value that is calculated for a particular grid cell is assigned (NHC 2016). The SLOSH MOMs provide a worst case scenario product as they are compiled based on the maximum storm surge height for all hurricanes of a given category regardless of forward speed, storm trajectory, or landfall location. Since the purpose of this assessment was to identify the vulnerability of the region to storm surge, and previous studies (Barnes, J., 2013;Clinch et al., 2012;Mulligan et al., 2014;Riggs, 2011;Sheng et al., 2010) illustrated the variability of storm surge as well as the geomorphic response to different storm events, the scenarios selected included the (MOMs) for Category 1 -5 storms occurring at high tide in order to identify the development that is the most vulnerable and use a worst case scenario to assist with prioritizing mitigation actions (Allen et al., 2013). Accurate and recent topographic and bathymetric data is a critical component to mapping potential inundation caused by storm surge. Fortunately, the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration's National Geodetic Survey Remote Sensing Division collected Quality Level 2 LiDAR data in 2014 for the North Carolina Floodplain Mapping program using a Riegl VQ820G system. The bare earth LiDAR that was produced from that mission was obtained through the North Carolina Emergency Management Spatial Data Download portal (rmp.nc.gov/sdd/) for the extent of the study area as individual tiles containing LAS files (an industry standard binary format for storing LiDAR data). LAS Dataset (Data Management) in ArcGIS 10.2 was used to create a mosaic all the tiles covering the study area. LAS Dataset to Raster was then used to create an elevation surface. The QL2 LiDAR had a point spacing of approximately 2 points per meter with a horizontal accuracy of 1.0 m root-mean-square error (RMSE) and vertical accuracy of 0.245 m RMSEz. These data allowed for the creation of a 1.5 meter resolution DEM using Natural Neighbor interpolation as the void filling method. A polygon delineating areas of water for the region was obtained through the National Hydrography Dataset and used to clip the extent of the DEM from the 2014 QL2 bare earth LiDAR. The resultant DEM was then used for the storm surge inundation mapping.\"\n",

The LRR technique is susceptible to error, nonetheless and inhomogeneity of variances. Individual shoreline dates may skew the estimate (detectable with residuals), and the method has a documented tendency to be a conservative estimate of change relative to EPR (Dolan et al. 1991;Genz et al. 2007.) Figure 7. Shoreline change measurement techniques employed using USGS DSAS. LRR was used for detailed analysis. Owing to concerns over the accuracy of the oldest t-sheet charts, these 1800s maps were not used to estimate the LRR rate of change. (Summaries adapted from USGS DSAS 6.)

This shoreline change assessment helped identify erosional hotspots in relation to the location of the historical districts.  (Figure 9). Linear regression rate (LRR) was chosen as the preferred method for analysis since it is statistically robust, quantitative method when a limited number of shorelines are available. LRR is also commonly applied for expressing shoreline movement and estimating rates of change ( Figure 5). Conducting the analysis with more recent shorelines derived from LiDAR should not only give additional temporal and spatial data but also can inform associated morphological changes. It must be recognized that many factors are driving shoreline changes including natural (e.g., storm-driven overwash and longshore transport) as well as anthropogenic activities (e.g., nourishments). To understand past and future changes requires knowledge of beach replenishments, lagged effects from alongshore pulses of erosion updrift, inlet opening and and other processes that modify the sediment budget (Inman and Dolan, 1989). Moreover, the geologic framework and regional-scale morphology may be important in controlling spatial and temporal changes in erosion.\"\n",

Future studies should consider more detailed, site-specific assessments that also factor in back-barrier estuarine shoreline movement as well as simulated sea-level and storm event scenarios to evaluate coastal vulnerability of these cultural resources. Limitations of this assessment include a paucity of finer temporal scale interannual change data and a purely empirical approach oriented to long-term trends. Recent storm-and human-cause modifications updrift and localized along Pea Island (e.g., the nourishment north of Rodanthe in 2015), Hatteras, and Ocracoke coastal compartments could impart short-and long-term changes with lag effects in shoreline response. In addition, the stability of Pea Island section of Highway 12 has been recently dependent upon almost continual engineering activity, and policies adopted and actions taken now and over the next decade or two (e.g., bridge construction) could have measurable along-shore consequences for sediment supply and thus shoreline, beach and dune morphology across the study area. Relative to potential SLR inundation and surges (discussed later) no CAHA sites exhibit a severe, immediate risk to oceanfront erosion. This result certainly includes significant risk reduction resulting from the relocation of the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse and associated quarters. Nonetheless, long-term rates of erosion are predominantly erosional with a high confidence of continued landward recession of the shorezone. Table 3 summarizes the rates and projects these linearly at 10, 25, and 50yr periods in the future from 2009. Figures 11-13 also depict the spatial proximity of each historic site to the oceanfront. Although no sites are directly impacted by shoreline erosion within these periods, the CG site at Bodie Island and the Ranger site at Cape Hatteras show the greatest increase in risk owing to oceanfront erosion. As the shoreline approaches these structures, other chronic and nuisance impacts may be expected to concomitantly increase (e.g., salt spray and wind) as windward landforms and vegetation degrade. Since the Hatteras Weather Bureau and Ocracoke Island occupy backbarrier and sheltered locations, these sites were not analyzed for proximity to oceanfront erosion risk, which is extremely low through the period of study.

Spatial analysis included co-registration in the horizontal (e.g., UTM earth coordinates) as well as adoption of a common vertical datum for all data (DEMs, buildings, and surges.) Storm surge modeling data was obtained from the SLOSH display program and used to map the extent and depth of inundation resulting from various storm scenarios ( Figure 6). The SLOSH model was developed by the National Weather Service's NHC to estimate storm surge from hurricanes using storm properties (e.g., track speed and direction, central pressure, and radius of maximum winds) (National Hurricane Center, 2015). The newest available SLOSH grids for the Hatteras area were obtained and coregistered to the NC LiDAR, building footprints, and other GIS datasets. We conducted a search and review of available building footprints and elevation data, including the NPS GIS databases, NC Floodplain Mapping Program, and the Dare County GIS. In 2009, the North Carolina Flood Mapping Program conducted a statewide acquisition of building footprints based on orthophotography to develop a statewide GIS layer for the purpose of vulnerability assessment, disaster mitigation, planning and flood forecasting. This effort included a program to collect first (or finished) floor elevation (FFE) data using mobile LiDAR and laser inclinometers in order to refine flood hazard assessments to the building footprint scale (NCFMP 2014). The FFE is a useful threshold to identify individual properties that are vulnerable to flooding because if the flood depth exceeds the FFE of a property, the owner may have to remediate interior and exterior damages. If the damage is severe, the property may become unusable, at least temporarily. FFE measurements were collected using various techniques under contract for NC Floodplain Mapping and FEMA (e.g., direct survey using leveling and RTK-GPS, mobile LiDAR measurement, measured and/or statistically estimated FFE above adjacent highest grades, and in some instances, measurement from the high density airborne QL2 LiDAR point clouds). NCFMP FFE data were adopted for the purpose of analysis. These data also have the benefit of well documented lineage, completeness, and currency as compared to the incomplete data sources from Dare County and NPS building data (methods undocumented, buildings incomplete, and some missing.)

Interestingly, , the development located in Rodanthe, Waves, and Salvo (also known as the \\\"Tri-Villages\\\") was not very vulnerable to a category 1 hurricane, only 4%, 5%, and 2% of the property within the respective communities had the potential to be inundated. However, the percentage of properties in the Tri-Villages that has the potential to be inundated jumps to over 30% for a category 2 hurricane. In contrast, the results for Ocracoke indicate that 12% of the properties are vulnerable to a category 1 hurricane, however, the percentage is drastically greater (57%) for a category 2 hurricane, the highest for all the communities. Finally, storm surge inundation produced from category 3-5 hurricanes has the potential to be severe for the entire region as the percent of properties vulnerable to inundation is greater than 47% for all of the communities.  The results of the storm surge mapping were first analyzed by the potential extent of inundation that could occur from the different category storm events as well as under different sea level rise scenarios. Based on the Storm Surge Vulnerability maps that displayed the potential extent of inundation (see appendices) it was determined that the region of the barrier island located adjacent to the Pamlico Sound is quite vulnerable to inundation beginning with a category 1 hurricane, as Hurricane Irene 2011demonstrated (Mulligan et al., 2014). The extent of potential inundation increases considerably between a category 1 and category 2 event, while the areas of potential inundation from a category 3 -5 event increase less drastically. In general, areas with an elevation of 3 meters (NAVD88) or above are the only areas that do not have the potential to be inundated by any category hurricane. Section 4 further examines whether this pattern persists with increasingly sea-level and specifically within NPS historic districts. The results of the storm surge community vulnerability assessment using the FFE of the building footprints affirm the wide extent of potential inundation. While 11% of the coastal development has the potential to be inundated by a category 1 hurricane, the number of properties that have the potential to be inundated by a category 2 hurricane is 42%, an increase of 31%. An additional 11% of properties have the potential to be inundated by a category 3 hurricane (i.e., 53%). Subsequently, an increase of 6% (59%) and 7% of structures was determined to be inundated by category 4 and 5 hurricanes, respectively. The results of the storm surge vulnerability assessment using the FFE of the building footprints illustrate that there is significant spatial variability in the vulnerability of properties; whereas the maps that display the potential extent of inundation are directly correlated with elevation.

Each building footprint and associated centroid is elevationally compared to the surge SLOSH surge category 1-4 height and the offset calculated.

The contemporary (baseline) Table 6 can then be compared to increasing risk with SLR, as in tables 6-10. Each cell of the table is color-coded to generalized categories of risk for relative comparison among surges and structures, yet consistency with time. Generally, each table portrays increasing risk, since SLR will raise the surge heights and potential impacts to structures. The following the map and tabular presentation graphics, individual district risk and overall risk are summarized in section 4.1.   At the current baseline condition without additional relative SLR, the basic vulnerability highlights structures vulnerable to storm surge inundation: \\uf0b7 At present-day (Table 5), various ancillary and infrastructure are the most vulnerable to inundation at even category 1 storm surge at Bodie Island and Ocracoke (e.g, cisterns and oil house structures). \\uf0b7 In addition, today category 2 storm surges for direct landfalling hurricanes present a slight to moderate risk of inundation to a variety of significant structures, including the visitor center and life saving stations at Bodie Island and Little Kinnakeet. \\uf0b7 Slight to moderate risk are also posed by category 2 storms today on Ocracoke, including the lighthouse, keepers quarters and shed. In tables 6-10, rising SLR presents a progression of increasing risk to structures with lower category of storm surges as SLR increases. Relative SLR of 20cm in Table 6 would be potentially realized between 2035-2055, depending on ensuing SLR. A mid-range estimate of relative SLR to reach 20cm in the CAHA region would be 2040-2045 (c.f., SLR curves of the NC CRC Science Panel (2010)). \\uf0b7 At 20cm of SLR (Table 6), the risk to several structures increases from minimal to slight for a category 1 storm, including the Bodie Island lighthouse and storehouse, Little Kinnakeet kitchen, shed and flag house at Hatteras Island. Present risks, already severe, also increase for cistems and oil house at Bodie Island. \\uf0b7 With a category 2 landfall (also Table 6), storm surge would present additional moderate risks to the Bodie Island Life Saving site structure, the visitors center, and Little Kinnakeet Boat House. These structures FFEs would be nearly 1m below the static surge height, which does not include wave action in the MOM modeling. Tables 7-10 present SLR scenarios with surges that are further out with time and/or portray a SLR acceleration. Table 8, +40cm SLR, would be potentially realized as soon as the early 2050s (translating to a 1.4m SLR rise by 2100) or as late as 2100 (using a linear projection of the last ~100yrs.) \\uf0b7 Table 8 +40cm SLR foresees an expansion of risk for category 1 surges to affect a large array of structures, including the boat house at Little Kinnakeet and shed at Hatteras Weather Bureau. \\uf0b7 Maximal Category 2 surges at +40cm SLR will also potentially elevate risks for the Ocracoke Light, keepers quarters and tool house and the Bodie Island LS&RS and Hilton CG. \\uf0b7 Category 3 surges with +40cm SLR also increase in risk severity to moderate level for Ocracoke, with surges from the MOMs predicting heights 0.68 to 0.79 meters above the FFE of these structures. Additional evaluation of Tables 8-10 is limited to discussion of the trends. These tables inherit a greater degree of uncertainty reflecting variation of eustatic SLR projections and climate models. The ranges of relative SLR in these tables cover +70cm to +140cm. These scenarios could be realized as soon as 2070 on the most aggressive SLR curve of the NC CRC Science Panel (1.4m rise by 2100). Generally, these scenarios and the timeframe are beyond the scope of work. Nonetheless, the progressive evolution of increasing risk and the potential severity illustrated in the tables is noteworthy. In addition to the site-and structure-specific tables of surge, SLR, and susceptibility of the FFEs, we include a few summary graphs that depict the evolving risk across categories of hurricane surges, percentage of structures flooded by storm surge and sea level rise height. \\uf0b7 Figure 19 illustrates that present day sea level poses only a slight relative risk to most CAHA structures. The FFEs of the structures are higher than the SLOSH MOM surges for most category 1 storms (of course, non-inclusive of superimposed wave action.) \\uf0b7 Nonetheless, with category 3 storms at current sea level, a majority of the CAHA structures are categorized as slight risk or higher (almost 50% moderate to severe) of surge heights exceeding the FFEs (Figure 19). This figure provides a baseline for overall interpretation of the surges with SLR in Figures 20 and 21. To effect risk reduction for individual and overall CAHA historic resource assets, various adaptation or mitigation options would need to be explored and implemented. The results here illustrate that there is a growing threat with sea level rise, even if current climatology of tropical storms were to remain unchanged in magnitude.  \"\n",

      "        \"text\": \"The NC Coastal Erosion Study (2016) published by NC DCM provides a thorough review of the efforts that have been conducted by federal, state, and local governments, as well as academia, to study and address ocean coastal erosion. The Coastal Erosion Study (2016) also discusses mitigation activities that are currently being used throughout the State and potential strategies that should be considered in the future. Beach nourishment is the strategy that has been most commonly used along the NC coast to mitigate erosion for the purpose of protecting NC Route 12 and maintain the operation of the transportation system. Beach nourishment is an effective \\\"soft\\\" engineering alternative that does not result in some of the impacts that result from the \\\"hard\\\" engineering solutions implemented to mitigate erosion through the construction of erosion control structures like, groins, jetties, breakwaters, and seawalls. Unlike more permanent erosion control structures which attempt to inhibit natural processes that result in coastal erosion, beach nourishment acts as a buffer and wards off the threat of coastal erosion temporarily requiring periodic maintenance to preserve the effectiveness of the mitigation strategy over the longterm. A total of 33 beach nourishment episodes have occurred throughout the study area including the recently completed Mirlo Beach Nourishment project (September 2014), conducted to protect a section of NC 12, locally known as \\\"S-Curves\\\" or \\\"S-Turns\\\", north of Rodanthe. Although some of the episodes were conducted to fill areas where breaching occurred and inlets opened following extreme storm events, the majority of these episodes have occurred in the same areas that are susceptible to lower magnitude storm events and exhibit highly erosional long-term shoreline trends. For example, a low pressure weather system that tracked offshore of the Outer Banks on February 7 th , 2016, caused overwash and breaching at Mirlo Beach in Rodanthe, the oceanfront of Buxton, and along the northern portion of Ocracoke Island. Although beach nourishment reduces the vulnerability of coastal development along the oceanfront, maintaining the integrity and viability of the transportation system via N.C. 12 is the primary purpose of the projects that have been completed in the past as well as future scoped and proposed projects. NCDOT is the primary agency responsible for determining the feasibility of such projects and they have identified three sections of NC 12 south of Rodanthe in Dare and Hyde Counties that experienced overwash events in recent years and justified conducting feasibility studies as a preliminary step of the National Environmental Policy Act process to identify potential project scope, range of estimated costs of completion, and project-specific concerns related to preserving the NC 12 transportation corridor. The sections include: \\uf0b7 Buxton Canadian Hole \\\"Hot Spot\\\" o NC 12 from Avon to Buxton feasibility study was completed in December 2015 \\uf0b7 Hatteras Village \\\"Hot Spot\\\" o NC 12 Hatteras Village feasibility study was completed in February 2016 \\uf0b7 Ocracoke Island \\\"Hot Spot\\\" o Feasibility study has not yet been initiated As a result of the NC 12 from Avon to Buxton Feasibility Study (2015) and according to Dare County, the Buxton Beach Nourishment Project will be constructed in 2017 and plans to widen 4.6 kilometers of oceanfront by approximately 75 meters for an estimated $25 million, with the majority of the funding coming from the Beach Nourishment Fund. Additional funding for this project will come from the establishment of a service district and is discussed in more detail below: The majority of the historical nourishment episodes that have occurred throughout the study area as well as both the recent Mirlo Beach Nourishment project and future Buxton Beach Nourishment project use hydraulic dredging techniques to pump sand on the beach. Beach nourishment using hydraulic dredging is an effective technique to supply sand to large project areas, but it is a costly option (as indicated by the estimated cost of the Buxton Beach Nourishment Project) that requires multi-agency coordination that can take years to complete from the time the project is identified as feasible, scoped, financed, permitted, and constructed. Although Dare County has (1) exhibited effective methods for financing nourishment projects through the establishment of the Beach Nourishment Fund and service district for the Buxton Beach Nourishment Project, and (2) been able to move through the regulatory process in order to conduct the beach nourishment, the identification of suitable source material may become a limiting factor that could reduce the viability of beach nourishment as an effective method to mitigate erosion in the future. The Coastal Erosion Study (2016) identifies four major potential sand sources that could be used for future nourishment projects, but they would all require the use of hydraulic dredging techniques. Beach nourishment that uses hydraulic dredging techniques have an expensive mobilization cost and therefore are only cost effect for large scale projects. The study also mentions that nourishment projects can utilize sand trucked to the beach from an upland source. However, the use of this technique is often limited to smaller site-specific projects, and the proximity of quarries with availability material to the study area serves as another limiting factor. Regardless of the technique used the sediment must have similar characteristics as the native beach where it is being placed (15A NCAC 7H .0312) although an exemption is provided for sediment from regularly maintained navigation channels. An alternative method of beach nourishment that was not discussed in the Coastal Erosion Study (2016) uses a technique known as \\\"back-passing\\\". Sand back-passing essentially harvests sand from accretional areas and deposits sand in erosional areas using excavators, dump trucks, and bulldozers. The method efficiently manages limited sand resources by reversing the natural migration of sediment along shore and \\\"balances\\\" the sediment budget. Although, large scale beach nourishment projects are the most effective for protecting infrastructure from coastal erosion by widening the beach to increase the buffer distance to the shoreline, or constructing large scale dunes to provide storm protection; back-passing can be an effective method to prolong the need for repetitive large scale re-nourishment projects. Potential impacts with back-passing include disturbing shorebird nesting habitat or threatened plant species, or unearthing or damaging buried historical shipwrecks and cultural items (Hafner, 2012). However, these impacts can be easily avoided with strategic site selection and planning to conduct the work outside of nesting seasons. Additional impacts and costs of back-passing are associated with \\\"wear and tear\\\" on the roadway infrastructure as dump trucks haul sand from the excavation site to the deposition site. However, since the study area has a continuous linear shoreline impacts to the roadway can be avoided depending on the project scope. Successful back-passing projects have recently been completed in multiple coastal communities in New Jersey 1 and can be referenced as an example. One critical factor associated with the back-passing projects is the development of a sediment budget. The New Jersey Beach Profile Network is surveyed bi-annually by the Stockton University Coastal Research Center and the results of the survey are used to identify trends in shoreline position. Quarterly surveys are conducted in areas that have erosional concerns using more densely spaced transects providing enough information to perform volumetric calculations. The Carteret County Shore Protection Office conducts a similar beach monitoring program that could also be used as an additional reference and perhaps a more suitable model for Dare and Hyde County to follow. It is recommended that Dare and Hyde County coordinate with the National Park Service unit of Cape Hatteras National Seashore to implement a beach monitoring program to identify sediment transport trends and develop effective management strategies to mitigate coastal erosion.\"\n",

      "        \"section_title\": \"Storm Surge Flooding\",\n",
      "        \"text\": \"Coastal flooding is the hazard with the longest history of hazard mitigation planning throughout the study region, primarily through participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which is administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The NFIP provides several regulatory products that participating communities use to support hazard mitigation through effective FIRMs contain critical pieces of information that are needed to support floodplain management and hazard mitigation planning such as floodplain boundaries, flood zones, and base flood elevations (BFEs). These regulatory products are developed using state of the art methods to 1) collect topographic and bathymetric conditions; 2) extensively model flood conditions from storm events with different probabilities for areas that are subject to both riverine and/or coastal flooding; and 3) facilitate the dissemination of flood risk information to the public, stakeholders, and community officials by hosting the adopted DFIRMs (Digital FIRMs) on interactive web mapping portals, such as the NC Flood Risk Information System (FRIS) developed by the NC Department of Public Safety. Even though the coastal flood risk mapping process has been continually improved through the collaboration with various partners in other federal agencies, academia, and the private sector to more accurately determine flood risk along dynamic coastal areas; the FIRMs are primarily used to determine mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements as well as the insurance rate for properties that are mapped within a flood zone. The level of effort to collect baseline topographic and bathymetric data, perform flood modeling, and complete the map update process is immense and takes years to become finalized and adopted, especially if there are appeals. Since the FIRMs are developed as part of the NFIP, flood risk projects are completed on a rotating basis for communities throughout the country. It can take up to a decade or more for FIRMs 2 to be updated, with priority given to more densely populated areas. Therefore the level of flood risk can become inaccurate as time passes beyond the effective date of a FIRM; especially if significant geomorphic changes have occurred, or significant rates of sea level rise/land subsidence exist in the area since the most recent coastal flood risk study was completed. Several web based tools have been developed by multiple federal agencies including the US Geological Survey (USGS) and the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to evaluate risk to coastal hazards. These web based tool can supplement regulatory products such as FIRMs and improve hazard mitigation planning. The USGS has developed the Coastal Change Hazards Portal, which provides interactive web mapping capabilities and downloadable data layers to analyze coastal change science along our Nation's coast. NOAA's Office for Coastal Management has performed a sea level rise mapping project at the regional level and made the Sea Level Rise (SLR) Viewer publicly available on the web so that coastal managers and scientists can use it as a screening tool to identify areas that are most vulnerable to sea level rise and increased flooding frequency. While the Coastal Change Hazards Portal and SLR Viewer are very useful tools for planning at the regional scale, decisions are often made at the individual property scale. The purpose of the storm surge vulnerability assessment was to demonstrate a methodology that could be initiated by a GIS analyst within a government agency, whether federal, state, county or other to reevaluate the vulnerability of coastal developments as new or updated information is acquired. For example, an assessment could be performed that identifies properties that have a FFE that is below the Base Flood Elevation associated with the location of the property on the effective and/or preliminary FIRMs. The assessment could also be repeated when new elevation data is acquired from coastal mapping projects that are either collected as routine surveys or following storm events in order to determine how vulnerability to storm surge changes in the interim between the release of new FIRMs. Elevation survey data with higher accuracy may also become available and the assessment could be repeated to determine if the vulnerability of properties in the surrounding areas changes (Allen et al., 2010). For example, the assessment could be repeated once the Buxton Beach Nourishment project is completed to determine the effect the project has on reducing the vulnerability of the surrounding infrastructure. An assessment could also be performed using depth grids that take sea level rise into consideration since the Storm Surge Vulnerability maps that included sea level rise scenarios only displayed the potential extent of inundation.\"\n",

      "        \"text\": \"In addition to periodic meetings and briefings between ECU faculty, students, and NPS CAHA staff, we incorporated engagement into this project to both inform the analysis as well as obtain feedback from the community and other agencies conducting similar research. At the state level, we provided presentations that included NC Floodplain Mapping Program, Albemarle-Pamlico National Estuary Partnership, and local government and geospatial and emergency management professionals. These included presentations at the NC ArcUser Group Conference and Eastern Symposium, presentations at NOAA Coastal GeoTools, APNEP Decision Support Working Group, NC Geographic Information Coordinating Council, and the NC Hurricane Workshop. Locally, Ms. Donna Creef, Planning Director for Dare County, was contacted after project student Michael Flynn was awarded a NC Sea Grant Coastal Policy Fellowship to set up a meeting to discuss the work and alignment with existing efforts by the Dare County Planning Department. An initial meeting was held February 5 th , 2016, at the Dare County Administration Building, which followed a meeting that was conducted with NPS staff to discuss progress on the cooperative agreement evaluating the vulnerability of the landmarks located within the Cape Hatteras National Seashore. Drew Pearson, Director of Emergency Management, was included and briefed on work for this CAHA project. We discussed how similar products could be developed for the communities located along the Outer Banks. These discussions resulted in participation in the Hurricane Preparedness and Safety Open House in May 2016. A planning team consisting of Drew Pearson, Donna Creef, Noah Gillam, Sara Small, Holly White, and Kevin Zorc, worked together to host not only the first, but possibly inaugural annual event. The initial event was held on Friday, May 20 th , 2016 from 3:00 to 8:00 pm at the Nags Head Fire Station 16, and a supplemental Open House was offered on Saturday, May 21 st at the Fessenden Center in Buxton to provide an opportunity for members in communities that lived in the southern Hatteras Island. The event at the Nags Head Fire Station 16 consisted of displays, activities, and guest speakers of numerous organizations that provided information that could be used by the public to improve hurricane preparedness. Mayor Edwards and Commissioner Woodard attended the event and provided opening remarks. I gave a presentation about conducting the Multi-Hazard Vulnerability Assessment before the feature presentation on storm surge was given by Jamie Rhome, Team Lead of the Storm Surge Unit of the National Hurricane Center, which was followed by a presentation on forecasts and warnings given by Richard Bandy, Meteorologist-in-Charge at the NWS Newport/Morehead City Office. Over 250 people attended the event and learned about tropical storms and hurricanes, flooding, citizen safety, mitigation construction products, and explored topics relative to the life cycle of disasterpreparedness, response, recovery, and mitigation. The attendees additionally enjoyed a cook out that was provided by the Nags Head Fire Department, and youth activities helped to make the event a truly inclusive community gathering that exemplified the best of a public/private partnership. Education and outreach is a critical component of hazard mitigation, and it is hoped that the Hurricane Preparedness and Safety Open House becomes an annual event that other communities can use as model. The event and collaboration with Dare County Planning spurred further interest and adoption of the same vulnerability assessment methodology for Outer Banks communities beyond the NPS Historic Districts.\"\n",

      "        \"text\": \"The coastal development located along the Outer Banks and adjacent to the Cape Hatteras National Seashore is vulnerable to multiple coastal hazards including, coastal erosion, storm surge, and sea level rise. The purpose of this assessment was to determine the vulnerability of national historic landmarks to each hazard so that mitigation strategies can subsequently be developed. Results affirm the notion of increasing susceptibility to inundation and attendant coastal hazards with increasing sea level rise. This assessment also demonstrated a GIS-based methodology that can be repeated by GIS and vulnerability analysts in when updated information that was used in the assessment becomes available. The methodology is also adaptable and portable to other NPS parks and facilities and surrounding communities. Providing the public with access to this information may help to guide mitigation or adaptation strategies for individual and community property to collectively increase the resiliency of the region to multiple coastal hazards. A number of limitations are notable for this study, necessarily constraining results and recommendations. First, the study made use primarily of existing data. The investigators required the best available coastal elevations and thus awaited the delivery of NC QL2 LiDAR, which pushed the study back several months. In addition, the availability of first floor elevation data was constrained; a mix of sources were initially found with variable documentation and unknown quality and accuracy. Hence, the project adopted a complete set of data from the NCFMP program (cross-checking against this in the field by spot-checking and against the limited FFEs from NPS.) Complex analytical steps required the conversion of all GIS data to a common vertical and horizontal datum, with some limitations and error inherently introduced in such processing. We were fortuitous with the release of a new SLOSH grid for the Hatteras region by the NWS National Hurricane Center, allowing some improvement to the downscaling of MOM inundation maps. Shoreline change analyses were completed for the oceanfront, but early in the project the team did not foresee the potential need to also include estuarine shoreline change and erosion rates. The vulnerability revealed by static SLR inundation for Bodie Island and, to a lesser degree, Little Kinnakeet, are suggestive of a need for closer examination of potential estuarine shoreline impacts to historic structures or ancillary facilities and roads at these sites. Similarly, island narrowing at other areas of CAHA, e.g., the Haulover or \\\"Canadian Hole\\\", may indicate a need to analyze estuarine shorelines for changes affecting park resources. A number of insights and potential benefits of this project may also be synthesized for other NPS CAHA purposes. First, although this study focused on historic structures, there are also potential impacts of SLR to natural resources, habitats, and ecosystem services throughout CAHA. To some extent, the data acquired and modeling in this study could inform such analyses. Static SLR and SLOSH grids, LiDAR DEMs, and shoreline data, for instance, could be assimilated in models such as the Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM) to evaluate marsh fragmentation, loss, or migration up elevation. Shoreline change rates calculated in this study are an input parameter to SLAMM. The LiDAR DEMs for this project have been converted to a vertical datum that is relatively straightforward to transform for SLAMM wetland modeling (using tidal datums.) The approach taken to analyze structures across storm surge impacts and SLR levels is applicable to habitats and even recreational visitor activities (e.g., trails, kitesurfing, windsurfing, fishing, camping or ORV beach use.) In the ensuing management application of this study, a few recommendations are also suggested to monitor and further predict sea level rise impacts on the park's cultural resources. The following specific tasks could improve management of these resources and any replication or follow-on study in the nearterm: \\uf0b7 Monitor the periodic reporting of sea level trends by NOAA and the NC Division of Coastal Management. o The NOAA Office for Coastal Management continues to provide the Sea Level Rise Viewer application and to support other federal, state and local agencies with trend summaries, geospatial data, and analysis tools. o Other NOAA entities such as Tides and Currents provide real-time and historic information and trends. https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/sltrends/sltrends.html o NC Division of Coastal Management coordinates the state's CRC Science Panel and tracking of trends for policy. Monitoring the DCM Sea Level site and its reports will facilitate reducing uncertainty for NC area projects of sea level rise https://deq.nc.gov/about/divisions/coastal-management/coastal-management-hottopics/sea-level-rise \\uf0b7 As SLR continues opportunities to improve risk assessments may evolve. NPS should evaluate newly available data from among various agencies. o New FEMA Digital Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) in preliminary review for the Outer Banks counties will be released. FIRMs will continue to be a relevant coastal management policy device, directly and indirectly affecting land use. NPS efforts to relocate, elevate, or redesign its assets may be impacted by changes in FIRMs affecting the surrounding communities. In addition, modeling of FIRMS incorporates wave action and potential storm impacts. New FIRMs may reveal near-term changes in storm surge wave energy zones that were not available to this study. o The NC Floodplain Mapping Program has a strong record of procurement of highresolution LiDAR elevation data, a critical component to this study. Future LiDAR, building and infrastructure data integrated by NCFMP may present a strong geospatial asset to the NPS. o The NC Coastal Atlas (https://www.nccoastalatlas.org/) and NC OneMap (http://data.nconemap.gov/geoportal/catalog/main/home.page) provide useful geospatial data repositories for the NPS CAHA and other NPS units in coastal North Carolina. The Atlas recently developed an inventory of coastal recreational assets, a coastal salinity database, and a series of \\\"marsh migration potential\\\" maps that could inform NPS planning for recreation or natural resources in CAHA.\"\n",

Historic District Field Visits A field visit with Laura Pickens introduced the team to sites for vulnerability assessment within the CAHA. The first stop on the visit was at the Bodie Island Lifesaving and Coast Guard Stations ( Figure  F1). Waves from the estuarine side of the Bodie Island Historic District were reported to have swashed through the parking lot almost to the Light Keepers' Station ( Figure F2) during Hurricane Irene in 2011. From the ground this region seemed appears sheltered, yet the 2012 NAIP DOQQ revealed the proximity to Roanoke Sound, Oregon Inlet, and the Atlantic Ocean ( Figure F3).  Little Kinnakeet Historic District was fenced off from the public and undergoing restorations. This historic district is located on the estuarine side along an undeveloped stretch between Salvo and Avon ( Figure F4). Cape Hatteras Lighthouse once stood at the site now marked by a ring of foundation stones ( Figure F5). These granite foundation stones had the names of the keepers that once served the lighthouse A B C engraved on them.

      "[{'section_title': 'Introduction', 'text': \"A significant body of research has been conducted in the past two decades to understand how consumers decide where to shop and the types of foods they purchase. Even though lowincome (LI) households' choices are constrained by financial barriers, their decisions about where to shop for food are similar to those of non-low-income (NLI) households. Findings on purchasing patterns of LI households are heterogeneous and difficult to compare and reconcile because of differences in the studies' scope and scale. Understanding the specific factors related to where people shop and what they purchase provides policymakers and practitioners opportunities to understand and appreciate the complexity of consumer behaviors and commensurately consider resource allocation related to changing behaviors. This study contributes to the literature by exploring where people buy food, and their purchases of specific foods/food categories using three datasets varying in scope and detail. The analysis is focused on a major US region, the Northeast (NE). Results from shoppers' intercept survey data collected at 13 stores in LI areas in nine Northeastern locations were compared with those obtained using secondary household food purchasing data from the Information Resource Incorporated (IRI) Consumer Network Panel (CNP) courtesy of the USDA Economic Research Service (ERS), and food expenditures from the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CES) of the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. The origin of the work presented here is a 7-year project conducted in the NE, with a longterm goal of determining whether greater reliance on regionally produced food might improve the food security of the region, and the community food security of LI communities throughout the region. In the nine project locations, one or two sites were selected, with a supermarket as the focal point of each site. To assess the type of food outlets chosen by households, we used a shopper intercept survey to identify both the primary and secondary stores patronized by respondents participating in federal food assistance programs (the survey's proxy for LI status) in urban and rural locations. The IRI data were used to measure the frequency of purchases, and the share of food expenditures at different types of food stores by households above and below 200% of the poverty threshold level. To gain insights on the types of food purchased, we compared the results of the analysis performed on the intercept surveys with those of the two secondary datasets with respect to specific market basket items (MBIs). In particular, we looked at purchasing patterns across demographic characteristics such as education level, income, usage of federal nutrition programs, race/ethnicity, urban and rural residency and presence of children in the household. The MBIs used in the intercept survey encompassed eight food products (bread, milk, ground beef, apples, fresh potatoes, frozen broccoli, canned peaches and cabbage). The purchasing patterns of six products were analyzed in detail using the IRI data. The analysis of the CES data utilized food categories. The results obtained using different data sources are reviewed and analyzed with regard to other findings in the literature.\"}, {'section_title': 'Literature review', 'text': \"We reviewed the literature that explored retail trends and where people shop as related to household income and rural/urban residency. We also reviewed studies of food purchasing patterns that included any analyses from primary and secondary data sources that were focused on the role of income, education, dietary disparities, children's presence in the household, rural/urban food patterns or race/ethnicity.\"}, {'section_title': 'Food shopping patterns: where do people shop?', 'text': \"Diversification in the food retail sector offers consumers multiple food-shopping venues, and all income groups employ a multiple store strategy, that is shopping at several stores on a regular basis (Stern et al., 2015). Using secondary data from the 2010 Nielsen Homescan Survey, Rahkovsky and Snyder (2015) reported that regardless of income, consumers shop at 11 different food stores over a year's time. Even people with household incomes less than $25,000 travel about 4.8 miles to shop-about the same average miles (5.2) as all households in their sample (Allcott et al., 2017). A recent industry report also found that on average, consumers shop at 5.4 different formats of grocery retailers (Gabbett, 2017). Despite these alternative shopping venues, studies consistently find that supermarkets (Broda et al., 2009;Alkon et al., 2013;Cannuscio et al., 2013;Ma et al., 2017;Ver Ploeg et al., 2017) or superstores (Taylor and Villas-Boas, 2016;Ver Ploeg et al., 2017) remain the top choice for food shopping, regardless of household income level, with the latter gaining market share (Stern et al., 2015). Studies reveal a variety of food shopping patterns with moderate variations across different income groups. A small study conducted in Philadelphia found that LI African American women spent a larger percentage of their food budget at limited assortment stores (e.g., Sav-A-Lot, Aldi's) (Chrisinger et al., 2018). Using 2005 Nielsen Homescan data, Broda et al. (2009) found that LI and middle-income households are more likely to shop at supercenters than high-income households, and high-income households are more likely to shop at club stores than LI and middle-income households. A more recent report from Ver Ploeg et al. (2017), however, found that supercenters are increasingly popular among all income groups with 44% of households using them for primary shopping compared to 45% using supermarkets. SNAP and food insecure households report similar shopping patterns as other households (Ver Ploeg et al., 2015). Rahkovsky and Snyder (2015) also found similar shopping patterns for low-income/low-access (LILA) and non-LILA households. This finding is not surprising given that nearly 40% of LI people in the USA live in neighborhoods that are not highpoverty neighborhoods (Wilde et al., 2014). Using Homescan and CES datasets, Damon et al. (2013) did find that SNAP households varied their food shopping locations once SNAP benefits were depleted; then relied on convenience and drug stores. Few studies report rural residents' shopping patterns. Using the national dataset FoodAPS, which tracks weekly shopping, Todd and Scharadin (2016) found insignificant differences in shopping locations and frequency between urban and rural households. A recent case study of five rural grocery stores found that residents spend nearly half of their food dollars at their locally owned store (Peterson and Proctor, 2018). Rural areas experience a scarcity of all food store types, with stores that carry the least healthful options the most prolific. Chain supermarkets are far more likely to be located in urban than rural areas, affecting affordability and availability (Liese et al., 2007;Powell et al., 2007;Bustillos et al., 2009;Dean and Sharkey, 2011;Campbell et al., 2017).\"}, {'section_title': 'Food shopping patterns: what do people buy?', 'text': \"Many factors, including income, participation in federal assistance programs, education, children in the household, rural/ urban status and race/ethnicity, are related to what foods people buy. Since purchasing is a reasonable metric of what people consume (Appelhans et al., 2017), determining food purchases provides a proxy for food consumption. In our intercept survey, we used SNAP as a proxy for income level. Andreyeva's et al. (2015) review of 25 studies on the dietary quality of SNAP participants found that they had a lower quality of diet than both income eligible and higher income participants, although caloric and nutrient intake were comparable. Similar to findings from FoodAPS, a national dataset on weekly shopping, Mancino et al. (2018) found that the nutritional quality of supermarket purchases was lower for SNAP recipients than other shoppers. Looking at the relationship of household income and food purchasing, Rahkovsky and Snyder (2015) found that over 1 year, households located in LILA areas purchased more foods overall, and specifically purchased more red meats, poultry, fish and sodas, and less fruits, vegetables and low-fat milk than non-LILA households. Two reports published by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER)- Handbury et al. (2015) and Allcott et al. (2017)-provide important insights into food purchasing in LI areas. The first is that the entry of new supermarkets into an area does not change consumer choices. Secondly, combining several secondary datasets to create composite variables, including the IRI dataset, Handbury et al. (2015) concluded that levels of education account for more of the variation in the quality of household food purchases than income. More educated shoppers purchased healthier foods more often than those less educated\"}, {'section_title': '2', 'text': \"Anne Palmer et al. shopping at the same store (Handbury et al., 2015), a finding that has been reported by others (Rahkovsky and Snyder, 2015;Mancino et al., 2018;. Using a structural demand model to understand the relationship between income and demand for healthy foods, Allcott et al. (2017) found that education accounts for approximately 21%, nutritional knowledge accounts for 7%, and differences in access to healthy foods account for about 5% of dietary differences. A recent study in two LI neighborhoods in Pittsburgh (Vaughan et al., 2017) corroborated some of these findings, reporting that educational achievement and being a SNAP recipient predicted food choices much better than where people shop. Research on the effect of children in the household and food purchasing is mixed. Using secondary data, Rahkovsky and Snyder (2015) looked at LI households with children under the age of 7 and found that they purchased 23% more fruit, 14% more low-fat red meats and 30% more low-fat milk products than households without children. In a study of 550 parentchild dyads with 40% of them classified as LI, researchers found that households with children that perceived cost as a barrier to purchasing produce did not have significantly different fruit and vegetable consumption patterns, by household income level; at the same time, households that spent the least amount on produce weekly also reported fewer daily servings of produce (Mushi-Brunt et al., 2007). Living in a rural area may also affect one's diet quality. Rahkovsky and Snyder (2015) learned that rural residents purchase larger amounts of red meat, less low-fat dairy and less produce than urban residents. Using primary data, another study found a small but statistically significant difference between urban and rural residents' fruit and vegetable consumption, with rural residents consuming less (Dean and Sharkey, 2011). Race and ethnicity are other factors to consider. Nielson's (2017) report on food retail and multicultural households noted that multicultural households (defined as Black, American Indian, Asian, Pacific Islander, other and two or more races and Hispanics of any race) spent a greater portion of their total food budget on fresh food categories, especially produce, seafood and meat. These patterns can be further disaggregated with Hispanic consumers spending more on fresh produce, packaged meat and juices; and Asian Americans spending more on seafood, followed by African Americans and Hispanics (Nielson, 2017). African American consumers bought poultry more frequently than any other group (Nielson, 2017). Some of the Nielsen findings are corroborated in published research on households and race. Zhen et al. (2009) observed that African Americans, Hispanics and Asians spent more on fish and seafood than whites. Rahkovsky and Snyder (2015) also found LILA African Americans purchased 60% more fish and poultry than white and Asian consumers as well as 31% more red meat. A small study in Houston found that African Americans allocated a greater proportion of their food budget to meat, fish, poultry and eggs than whites (Cullen et al., 2007). Another study conducted in Minnesota found that urban, LI African American women buy more meats like poultry and fish compared with other racial/ethnic groups, who spent more on beef and pork (Dammann and Smith, 2010). In the produce category, Hispanics (Nielson, 2017) and Asians spend more on fresh produce than whites and African Americans (Cullen et al., 2007;Zhen et al., 2009); African Americans purchase 11% more fruit than whites and Asian consumers (Rahkovsky and Snyder, 2015), while another study found no differences in produce purchases among racial groups (Dammann and Smith, 2010). It should be noted that none of these studies accounts for frozen produce sales. The findings summarized above indicate that different geographic contexts, racial categories, data sources and methodologies will lead to different results. Aside from the superstore finding, the analysis that follows corroborates much of what is known about shopping patterns and provides additional insights into differences in purchasing patterns particularly for race/ethnicity, and their relationship to income, education and other variables.\"}, {'section_title': 'Methods', 'text': 'Because each dataset offers specific metrics for certain variables, we created a table that describes each variable and how it is measured (see Table 1).'}, {'section_title': 'Primary data: customer intercept survey-data collection and analysis', 'text': \"Data collection took place at 13 'study stores' in nine project locations across the region from November 2012 to April 2015. The two eligibility criteria were that the store met the Food Marketing Institute (FMI) definition of a supermarket (a store that sells groceries, meat and produce and has at least $2 million in annual sales) and that it stocked all the MBIs. The MBIs consisted of whole and low-fat milk, white and whole wheat bread, regular and lean ground beef, fresh apples, cabbage, potatoes, frozen broccoli with and without sauce, and canned peaches in syrup and in juice. We selected a small number of MBIs because the foods formed the core of what was studied by all three research teams, including production and distribution. As illustrated in Clancy et al. (2017), we chose the specific items for many reasons, including that they would be staple foods for many LI households in the NE. The study stores were located in urban and rural locations, in zip codes where the median household income was near or below the median income for the state and county. About half of the stores were in zip codes with poverty rates above 20% and all were in counties with participation in SNAP greater than 10%. In all our study locations, the average food insecurity rate was approximately 13% (or higher), slightly above the regional average in 2013 of 12% (Coleman-Jensen et al., 2017). Summary statistics for the demographic characteristics of the surrounding areas of the 13 study stores are reported in Table 2. Project staff used intercept surveys to collect data from customers exiting the study store (n = 1996). Those interviewed were required to be 18 years or older and the primary food shopper in their household. Data collection took place across 9 of the 12 months, in mornings, afternoons and evenings. We included questions about respondents' demographic and household characteristics, including if they participated in any federal nutrition programs such as SNAP, WIC, school breakfast and lunch, where they shopped, and whether they had purchased any of the eight MBIs over the past 30 days. The survey also asked about the store choices of the respondents. The stores that respondents identified as the primary (where they do most shopping) or secondary stores (up to two other stores) were then categorized following the classification from the FMI's (Food Marketing Institute, 2015) food retail segment and Hawkes (2008) (see Fig. 1 and the Appendix). T-tests for differences in means Renewable Agriculture and Food Systems allowing for unequal variance of unpaired data were performed on several categories of questions. All analyses were conducted using STATA V. 14. Secondary data: data sources, data manipulation and analysis IRI Consumer Network Panel data The IRI CNP collects information on food purchases and demographic characteristics for a sample of more than 100,000 households across the USA (see Muth et al., 2016, for a discussion of the methodology and the data). The USDA ERS provided the data via a third-party access agreement. The dataset contained food-at-home purchases for multiple years. Sampling weights were available to produce a nationally representative sample, as well as US Census regions for a subsample of the data, the 'static panel'. The sample was restricted to 12,770 households in the EFNSE NE. Purchases for the year 2012 were aggregated at the annual level, the first year demographic data were available. National population sample weights were used instead of the NE ones, as these are created based on the US Census NE definition, which differs slightly from the EFSNE NE. Data manipulation: Household demographic attributes available in the IRI data include income, size, race/ethnicity and education of the household head, county of residence and the number of children (by age group). All purchase information in the CNP refers to the entire household because the primary shopper is not identified in the dataset. Household income and size were used to segment the sample into two groups based on whether the household was at or below 200% of the US Census Bureau Poverty Threshold (U.S. Census Bureau, 2012); households at or below this threshold were defined as LI whereas those above were NLI. This definition follows that used by the ERS-USDA in their Food Access Research Atlas. Participants' county of residence was linked with the USDA (2013) Rural-Urban Continuum Codes (RUCCs) (United States Department of Agriculture, 2013) to determine if the household was located in an urban or rural area. Participants residing in counties in metro areas (RUCCs 1-3) were categorized as urban while all others (RUCCs 4-9) were categorized as rural. Data analysis: The CNP dataset includes information on the different types of stores where the purchases took place, namely grocery stores (similar to supermarkets in the intercept survey and CES dataset), superstores, club stores, mass merchandisers, drug stores, dollar stores, convenience stores and 'all others.' An illustration of the different store-types included in the CNP data can be found in Volpe et al. (2017). Weight-adjusted differences in means using national sampling weights were calculated to assess how food expenditure shares, and the number of purchase occasions at the different types of stores varied for LI and NLI households and urban and rural households. It should be noted that these values do not include purchases as the product sold as 'random weight' items (e.g., bread from the bakery department) and only represent packaged products, including produce items. Additionally, the CNP data were used to analyze purchasing patterns, as described in Cleary et al. (2017) and Clancy et al. (2017). In this paper, we summarize some of the MBI purchase results illustrated in those two papers, as well as an original analysis of the differences between purchasers and non-purchasers of selected MBIs. All the analyses performed with the CNP data are weight-adjusted tests for differences in means using the sampling weights and were performed using STATA v.14. The CES is a survey that collects data on US households and their purchases of multiple products including foods. The survey uses national and regional probability samples of US households representative of the civilian, non-institutionalized population (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2016a). Participating households are recruited through the mail and data collection is conducted through face-to-face interviews and paper surveys (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2016b). Primary respondents for the CES are considered to be the head of household (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2016a). The CES includes two unique survey components: the Household Characteristics Questionnaire and the Expenditures Diary. Data for this research were obtained by linking the two datasets through a common identifier for every quarter in 2012, 2013 and 2014. The final dataset included 3428 household observations for the NE. Data manipulation: The primary survey respondent reports socio-demographic characteristics for themselves and their household; those included in the analysis were chosen for their significance in the literature regarding associations with purchasing behaviors and their similarity to independent variables in the customer intercept survey data. The socio-demographic variables included in the analysis are: household income (LI or NLI), based on whether the household was at or below 200% of the US Census Bureau Poverty Threshold (coded as 0 for households with income above-and 1 for those below); children younger than 18 in the household; ethnicity of the primary respondent (non-Hispanic, Hispanic); race of the primary respondent (White, Black, Asian and Other); education of the primary respondent (less than a college education, college education and more than college); and household participation in SNAP in the last 12 months. Purchasing data on the 104 food items in the survey were combined into 12 categories and sub-categories from the USDA What We Eat in America methodology used in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey national food survey (USDA, 2016). The categories and sub-categories included milk and dairy, meats, poultry, seafood, eggs, cured meats, non-meat proteins, mixed dishes, grains, snacks and sweets, fruit and vegetables. The USDA categories and sub-categories were used as binary dependent variables, coded as a zero '0' if there were no purchases within that category over the two consecutive week sampling interval and '1' if there was a purchase within that category. Data analysis: To maintain consistency with the CNP analysis, χ 2 tests for independence were conducted to assess differences in food purchasing within the 12 food categories by income level. Renewable Agriculture and Food Systems 5 For the remaining variables, multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to estimate the associations between sociodemographic characteristics and purchasing of foods within the categories.\"}, {'section_title': 'Results', 'text': ''}, {'section_title': 'Where people shop', 'text': \"Customer intercept surveys: primary and secondary stores We found that the majority (88%) of respondents used grocery stores (including traditional supermarkets-63%-and limited assortment stores-25%) as their primary store for food shopping. Figure 1 includes the descriptive statistics for the analysis of declared primary and secondary food stores. Approximately 7% shopped at supercenters. Similar patterns were noted for secondary stores with grocery stores being the most frequented (78-60% traditional supermarkets and 17% limited-assortment stores), followed by supercenters (10%). Additionally, we analyzed whether differences in participants' declared primary store for food purchases differed according to their participation in federal nutrition programs (N = 1,117 participating; N = 859 non-participating) and urban-rural status (N = 1,595, urban; N = 402, rural); see values in Table 2. Almost 60% of respondents in federal nutrition programs identified a supermarket as their primary store, vs 69% of non-program participants (values statistically different from one another). A higher percentage of participants using federal nutrition programs, however, declared to shop at limited-assortment stores than those not using food assistance (30 and 18%, respectively). No statistical difference emerges for the percentage of primary shoppers using traditional supermarkets in rural and urban areas (65 and 64%, respectively). A larger percentage of urban participants used limited-assortment stores (26%) as their primary store than rural participants (15%). However, a higher share of rural participants than urban declare supercenters as their primary stores (18 vs 4%) ( Table 3). Secondary data: expenditure shares and shares of purchase occasions The analysis that follows focuses on the average share of expenditure and purchase occasions of households in the EFSNE NE as they appear in the CNP for the year 2012. As previously mentioned, these values do not include random weight purchases and only represent packaged products. The analysis discussed below will focus on the share of the number of trips (over total number of trips to all store types) and expenditure shares (over total food purchases at all store types) by store type. The values in Figure 2 show that, overall, the largest shares of both food expenditures and purchase occasions are recorded for grocery stores (67 and 57%, respectively). Supercenters comprise about 10% value of sales (8% of purchase occasions), followed by the aggregate 'all others' store types (amounting to 7% expenditures and 11% of purchase occasions). Differences in food expenditure shares at different store types by income and urban status are presented in Table 4. The data show small differences in the expenditure shares between LI and NLI households for all food stores except 'all others' and mass merchandisers. In particular, NLI have a higher share of food expenditures than LIs at both grocery stores and club stores, and a lower share at superstores, dollar stores and convenience stores. Urban households show higher food expenditure shares than rural ones for all store types except in the case of superstores (where rural household had 16% higher shares than urban ones) and dollar stores (2%). \\nThe values in Figures 1 and 2 show the importance of grocery stores (which include both traditional supermarkets and limited \"}, {'section_title': '6', 'text': 'Anne Palmer et al.'}, {'section_title': 'What people buy', 'text': \"Customer intercept surveys: purchase frequencies of MBIs MBI purchasing results were very similar for both program and non-program participants, although a larger percentage of program participants purchased all the produce items compared to non-participants, except apples. As reported by Clancy et al. (2017), intercept survey respondents showed a higher share of purchasing any of the MBIs (except cabbage) if they had children under the age of 5 in the household. IRI CNP: characteristics of purchasers and non-purchasers of MB items Using the 2012 CNP data, we analyzed purchasing patterns of MBIs in the NE across NLI and LI households and urban and rural households. Income: Compared to NLI households, a larger share of LI households were purchasers of all the MBIs, purchasing also larger quantities, most likely because NLI households purchase more food away from home (Saksena et al., 2018). A smaller share of LI households purchased skim/low-fat milk and lean ground beef compared to NLI, whereas a larger share purchased whole milk, non-lean ground beef and potatoes. The values illustrated below in Table 5 synthesize the analysis of the difference in means between groups of purchasers and nonpurchasers of the different MBIs as a function of demographic characteristics and LI and NLI status (N = 2481 for LI, and N = 10,289 for NLI). Children: Overall, LI and NLI households with younger children had a higher percentage of purchasers than non-purchasers for almost all the MBIs. For households with younger children, there were no differences in the percentages of purchasers and Renewable Agriculture and Food Systems non-purchasers of whole milk and lean ground beef. A higher share of households with older children purchased skim milk, regardless of household income. Frozen broccoli purchasers were similar across LI and NLI households with children. Among both LI and NLI households with older children, we observed a higher share of purchasers of regular ground beef and white bread, compared to non-purchasers. We also found a higher share of purchasers of white bread among LI and NLI households with older children but not LI with younger children. Race and ethnicity: For whole milk, we found a larger share of purchasers than non-purchasers for both LI and NLI households with a black household head. A higher share of purchasers of lean ground beef was observed for both LI and NLI white households. We also found a higher share of purchasers of white bread among NLI black and Hispanic household heads. Income categories: Smaller percentages of households with incomes less than $14,990 were purchasers of many of the MBIs (with the exception of whole milk and regular ground beef), compared to purchasers. LI households with incomes between $35,000 and $59,999 have larger shares of purchasers of both skim milk and whole milk, regular ground beef, both white bread and wheat bread, peaches, broccoli and potatoes. We also find more purchasers than non-purchasers among NLI households in the same income bracket for whole milk, regular ground beef and white bread. Education: With regard to levels of education, both LI and NLI households headed by people with some high school, or high school graduates, show higher shares of purchasers (compared to non-purchasers) of whole milk, regular ground beef, white bread, potatoes and peaches. NLI households headed by a person with some college show more purchasers than non-purchasers when it comes to whole milk, both types of ground beef, both types of bread, peaches and potatoes. NLI households headed by a high school graduate also showed more purchasers than nonpurchasers when it comes to whole milk, regular ground beef, both types of bread, peaches, broccoli and potatoes.\\nIn this section, we review the findings of the analysis of the CNP and intercept survey data separately from those of the CES data to avoid confusion between specific foods and categories of foods. Where possible, we also compare these findings with the literature. As noted in Table 1, income is defined by federal nutrition program participation for the intercept survey, and by above and below 200% of the poverty level for CNP and CES. Both the intercept results and the CNP analysis find a higher percentage of LI households to be purchasers of all the MBIs than NLI households, purchasing also larger quantities, most likely because NLI households purchase more food away from home (Saksena et al., 2018). Our findings align with Rahkovsky and Snyder's (2015) research that LI households purchase more foods to be consumed at home overall. Looking at specific market basket foods, the intercept survey data show a higher share of program participants being purchasers of all fruits and vegetables in the market basket than nonparticipants. In contrast, the results of the CES analysis show smaller shares of households using SNAP purchasing fruit, results. Also, comparable to Rahkovsky and Snyder's (2015) finding that LILA purchase less fruit, and to Leung et al. (2012) who report that SNAP participants consume fewer fruits and vegetables. The intercept findings may reflect the popularity of produce items in the MB compared to the broad category of fruit used in CES. Both LI and NLI households show a higher incidence of purchasers of skim milk than non-purchasers; in contrast, Rahkovsky and Snyder (2015) report that LILA households are more likely to purchase low-fat milk than non-LILA. Our finding may reflect a trend away from whole milk purchasing, except for African American households. The intercept findings on bread purchasing patterns are similar to those obtained with the IRI CNP data, a higher share of LI households are purchasers of wheat and white bread. The intercept found that program participant respondents are equally likely to purchase whole wheat bread as non-program participants. Because wheat bread is significantly more expensive than white bread, LI households (or program participants) may place a high value on the nutritional differences between wheat and white bread. Those households participating in the WIC program are urged to purchase wheat bread, which could account for part of the difference (Andreyeva et al., 2011). The analysis of the IRI CNP data found that LI and NLI households are equally likely to purchase ground beef, although smaller percentages of LI households purchase lean ground beef, which likely is a function of lean ground beef's higher price or taste preferences. Smaller percentages of LI households in the CES purchase foods in nine of the 12 food categories than those above the poverty threshold, in contrast to the findings obtained from IRI CNP and intercept survey data that a higher share of LI households are purchasers of all MBIs, which may be due to the fact that we consider food categories in the CES and individual foods in the CNP and the intercept survey. In summary, the IRI CNP and the intercept results find that LI households purchased more MBIs and show similar purchasing patterns for low-fat milk and wheat bread as non-LI households. While there is no difference in the share of purchasers and nonpurchasers of ground beef among LI households, a smaller share purchases lean ground beef. The CES analysis finds a smaller share of LI purchasing milk and dairy, meats, eggs, cured meats, non-meat proteins, fruit, vegetables, snacks and sweets and mixed dishes. Heterogeneity of patterns may reflect differences in taste and cultural preferences and health-seeking behaviors. Education: Similar to the findings from Handbury et al. (2015), we find that a smaller share of respondents with higher levels of education of the household head (college graduate and holding a post-graduate degree) are purchasers of some of the 'less healthy' MBI (whole milk, regular beef, white bread); a result that holds only for white bread in LI households. Children in household: Both the analyses of the IRI CNP and intercept survey data show that having young children in the household is associated with purchasing the majority of the MBIs. Similarly, the analysis of the CES finds that having children in the households is associated with purchasing across all food categories. LI and NLI households with young children show more purchasers than non-purchasers for almost all the MBIs, including skim milk, lean ground beef, wheat bread, frozen broccoli and potatoes. A likely reason for this result is that households with children may prepare more meals at home while seeking to meet dietary needs for children's growth. This finding may also reflect participation in the WIC program. Rural: We find no significant differences between urban and rural households with regards to purchasing the MBIs, while Rahkovsky and Snyder (2015) find that LILA urban households purchases are similar to non-LILA rural households. Race and ethnicity: Most of our findings related to race and ethnicity support previous literature, although most of the literature focuses on proteins and produce. In the protein category, we found a larger share of Hispanics purchasing seafood and poultry, and a larger share of Asians purchasing seafood. Zhen et al. (2009) also found that Hispanics, Asians, as well as African Americans spend more on fish and seafood than whites. The CES analysis finds that a larger share of African Americans are purchasers of poultry, similar to Nielson (2017), Zhen et al. (2009) and Rahkovsky and Snyder (2015). In the produce category, we found a higher percentage of Hispanics being purchasers of fruit, similar to Nielson's (2017) findings. Other studies have found that Asians also spend more Renewable Agriculture and Food Systems on fresh produce than whites and African Americans (Zhen et al., 2009;Cullen et al., 2007). The CES analysis found that a smaller share of African Americans purchased fruits and vegetables, in contrast to Rahkovsky and Snyder (2015) who report that African Americans spent 11% more on fruit. Studies conducted on ethnic populations have found that the major barriers among LI populations to the purchase and consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables are the high cost and high spoilage rates, a perceived lack of time and the extensive preparation time for cooking vegetables (Yeh et al., 2008;Stephens et al., 2015). Further, the analysis of the CES and IRI CNP both find distinct purchasing differences across ethnic groups for dairy categories, with a larger share of African Americans being non-purchasers of milk and dairy. Rahkovsky and Snyder (2015) also found that African Americans are less likely to purchase dairy products, possibly due to higher rates of lactose intolerance.\"}, {'section_title': 'Consumer expenditure survey', 'text': 'Using data from the 2012-2014 CES, we analyzed food category purchases by income level, which are presented in Table 6. LI households show lower percentages of purchasers for nine of the 12 food categories, with the most marked purchasing differences in non-meat proteins, vegetables and mixed dishes. There are no differences in purchasing between LI and NLI households for poultry, seafood and grains. We also assessed associations between socio-demographic characteristics and food purchasing, which are presented in Table 7. Having children in the household (31% of the sample) is positively associated with purchasing across all food categories; the most significant differences appeared in grains and milk and dairy. The CES data show that households using SNAP (10% of the sample) show a smaller share of fruit purchasers, compared to non-purchasers. Ethnicity and race are associated with different purchasing patterns, particularly in the protein and dairy categories. A higher percentage of Hispanics, compared to non-Hispanics purchased poultry, seafood, meats, eggs non-meat proteins and fruit. Smaller percentages of African Americans and Asian respondents instead purchased milk and dairy, cured meats, and fruits and vegetables.

Both in terms of being the primary or secondary store, and in terms of expenditure and purchase occasion shares, supercenters and other formats are of secondary importance. These findings are similar to previous research which show, regardless of income, that most households utilize traditional supermarkets for their food shopping; the results of food expenditure shares using the CNP data follow the same pattern. Unlike previous studies (Broda et al., 2009;Taylor and Villas-Boas, 2016;Ver Ploeg et al., 2017), our results overall show supercenters as a distant second to supermarkets in terms of store preference, expenditures and purchase occasions. From the intercept data analysis, we find that a larger shares of respondents participating in federal nutrition programs shop at limited-assortment supermarkets, compared to nonparticipants, with 30% of them identifying limited-assortment stores as their primary store, similar to the Chrisinger et al. (2018) findings that lower income households spend a larger percentage of their budget at limited assortment stores. The intercept findings may reflect the characteristics and locations of our sample of shoppers. Most limited assortment stores meet the classification of a supermarket used in other datasets and offer competitive prices, which may account for their popularity among LI households. Differences in food expenditure shares at different store types by income and urban status are presented in Table 4. The data show small differences in the expenditure shares between LI and NLI households for all food stores except 'all others' and mass merchandisers. In particular, NLI households have a higher share of food expenditures than LI households at both grocery stores and club stores, and a lower share at superstores, dollar stores and convenience stores. Similar to Broda et al. (2009), we find small differences in food expenditures between LI and NLI purchasing at convenience stores (1.5 vs 0.7%).   \"}, {'section_title': '10', 'text': \"Anne Palmer et al. While convenience and dollar stores are increasing their presence in rural areas (Bustillos et al., 2009;Campbell et al., 2017), when compared to urban households, both the intercept and IRI CNP data analysis find that a larger share of rural households use supercenters/superstores and show higher food expenditures at these store types than urban households. Like urban households, supermarkets are the declared primary store and also rank highest in expenditures. This finding is corroborated in a recent case study of five rural grocers that found residents spend nearly half of their food dollars at their locally-owned grocery/supermarket (Peterson and Proctor, 2018). Supermarkets may be located in an LI, middle-or high-income neighborhood but attract shoppers from different income categories or be located in an LI neighborhood and attract middle-and high-income shoppers. Rahkovsky and Snyder (2015) discuss census findings from 2010 that estimate 32% of urban and 42% of rural residents live in LI areas but are not poor themselves. This is similar to Wilde's et al. (2014) finding that 40% of LI people live in neighborhoods that are not high poverty, making placebased interventions an imperfect solution to food access problems.\"}, {'section_title': 'Limitations', 'text': \"The key variables in this study are measured in a variety of ways, which makes comparing across the datasets challenging and may account for some of the differences in our findings. For example, the definition of, and the language describing store categories vary with small but significant differences as to what constitutes a supermarket, grocery store, small grocery, etc. The definition of the stores used in the IRI data analysis does not uniquely match that of the FMI. With current retail trends, it would be helpful for future analyses to use a standard classification to ensure comparability. For example, the FMI's categorization is the one most cited and is used for this paper with a modification. Measurements for store preferences also vary. The IRI dataset uses expenditures and purchase occasions as the metric for store preferences, while the intercept survey uses self-reported store preferences. The issue of purchasing variables arises in many studies. The CES utilizes aggregated food groups and the IRI and the intercept survey utilize a limited number of food items. Also, the IRI does not measure non-packaged produce items, which means the analysis is missing non-packaged produce purchases and produce purchased outside of the MBIs. As noted in Table 1, the choice of demographic questions also varies across datasets. For example, the intercept survey asks about children in the household under the age of 5 while the other two datasets ask about children under the age of 18. Income and poverty measures also vary across datasets, which may account for some variation in our results and comparability. In our intercept survey analysis, we used participation in any federal nutrition program as a proxy for income, while for the analysis of the IRI CNP and CEE data, we used the 200% or less of the federal poverty line. This means we have not captured the gap between 200% of the poverty line and the cutoffs for SNAP, WIC and school lunch eligibility.\"}, {'section_title': 'Conclusion', 'text': \"Our analysis used three datasets to describe trends in store choice and food purchasing among LI households in the NE USA. One strength of this study is the ability to examine a number of variables that have shown to be correlated with shopping and purchasing decisions and compare the findings with trends and analyses that have been reported in other studies. Some of the differences we found may be a reflection of the characteristics of shoppers in the NE region. We may also be witnessing changes in shopping and purchasing trends that are taking place over time. Using a multi-faceted approach to understand the suite of factors related to the food purchasing of LI households challenges researchers to consider the complexity of the issue. We offer two notable findings on store choices about limited assortment supermarkets and supercenters. The analysis of the intercept survey shows that one in four urban residents use limited assortment stores as their primary store, and that a larger share of program participants shop at limited assortment stores compared to non-participants. The appeal of this store format for LI or urban individuals warrants further research to understand how these smaller format supermarkets can fulfill nutritional needs without the level of investment (and profits) required to support superstores or supermarkets. Also, supercenters appeal to rural residents more than urban; however, the CNP data suggest that supercenters comprised only 10% of sales and 8% of purchase occasions of food-at-home. While nationwide trends continue to show superstores with increased market share, we did not find that trend from the IRI or the intercept data for the NE. Our review of the literature also indicates that there is a paucity of research on rural households' food purchasing habits: a gap that should be filled with more studies and tested for replicability. It is also possible that other studies have not found significant differences between urban and rural households, thus are not reporting a null finding. Understanding these gaps would help inform interventions and policymaking in the rural arena. We find a few studies that look at purchasing patterns and children in the household. Based on our findings, the presence of children is correlated with healthier food purchasing in the household, similar to Rahkovsky and Snyder (2015) (see page 6). Additional research on the role of children in shifting purchase patterns would help define opportunities for intervention. Another finding worth emphasizing is that while differences in purchasing patterns across household income levels may be statistically significant, they are small, and are likely not of public health significance. Except for whole milk and lean ground beef, our intercept survey data reveal similar purchases across program participants and non-participants. The analysis of IRI data finds a smaller share of LI households to be purchasers of low-fat milk and lean ground beef than NLI households, while the CES data showed racial and ethnic differences, regardless of income. At this point, it may not be as important to study these types of differences as it is to acknowledge that several recent studies point out that demand for healthy foods is a much greater driver of purchases than supply is. Research that focuses on why these differences exist may be more useful to programs and interventions and even policies than more information about what the differences are, as we illustrated earlier with regard to LI ethnic food choices. For those seeking to increase healthier purchasing for specific audiences, some of these findings on specific foods may be useful. For example, because wheat bread is purchased by all income groups, researchers could investigate what has motivated households to change from white to wheat bread (Chase et al., 2003). Racial and ethnic preferences for protein foods may guide program implementers to suggest culturally appropriate products with healthier preparation methods. While households at all income levels fail to meet dietary guidelines, LI households encounter additional challenges with lower levels of education, and less access to transportation, and purchasing decisions may reflect those challenges. Thus, it will be important for policymakers, practitioners and researchers to examine more deeply the context and the complexities of food purchasing choices of LI households that go beyond quantitative analyses.\"}]\n"

      "        \"text\": \"A significant body of research has been conducted in the past two decades to understand how consumers decide where to shop and the types of foods they purchase. Even though lowincome (LI) households' choices are constrained by financial barriers, their decisions about where to shop for food are similar to those of non-low-income (NLI) households. Findings on purchasing patterns of LI households are heterogeneous and difficult to compare and reconcile because of differences in the studies' scope and scale. Understanding the specific factors related to where people shop and what they purchase provides policymakers and practitioners opportunities to understand and appreciate the complexity of consumer behaviors and commensurately consider resource allocation related to changing behaviors. This study contributes to the literature by exploring where people buy food, and their purchases of specific foods/food categories using three datasets varying in scope and detail. The analysis is focused on a major US region, the Northeast (NE). Results from shoppers' intercept survey data collected at 13 stores in LI areas in nine Northeastern locations were compared with those obtained using secondary household food purchasing data from the Information Resource Incorporated (IRI) Consumer Network Panel (CNP) courtesy of the USDA Economic Research Service (ERS), and food expenditures from the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CES) of the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. The origin of the work presented here is a 7-year project conducted in the NE, with a longterm goal of determining whether greater reliance on regionally produced food might improve the food security of the region, and the community food security of LI communities throughout the region. In the nine project locations, one or two sites were selected, with a supermarket as the focal point of each site. To assess the type of food outlets chosen by households, we used a shopper intercept survey to identify both the primary and secondary stores patronized by respondents participating in federal food assistance programs (the survey's proxy for LI status) in urban and rural locations. The IRI data were used to measure the frequency of purchases, and the share of food expenditures at different types of food stores by households above and below 200% of the poverty threshold level. To gain insights on the types of food purchased, we compared the results of the analysis performed on the intercept surveys with those of the two secondary datasets with respect to specific market basket items (MBIs). In particular, we looked at purchasing patterns across demographic characteristics such as education level, income, usage of federal nutrition programs, race/ethnicity, urban and rural residency and presence of children in the household. The MBIs used in the intercept survey encompassed eight food products (bread, milk, ground beef, apples, fresh potatoes, frozen broccoli, canned peaches and cabbage). The purchasing patterns of six products were analyzed in detail using the IRI data. The analysis of the CES data utilized food categories. The results obtained using different data sources are reviewed and analyzed with regard to other findings in the literature.\"\n",

      "        \"text\": \"Diversification in the food retail sector offers consumers multiple food-shopping venues, and all income groups employ a multiple store strategy, that is shopping at several stores on a regular basis (Stern et al., 2015). Using secondary data from the 2010 Nielsen Homescan Survey, Rahkovsky and Snyder (2015) reported that regardless of income, consumers shop at 11 different food stores over a year's time. Even people with household incomes less than $25,000 travel about 4.8 miles to shop-about the same average miles (5.2) as all households in their sample (Allcott et al., 2017). A recent industry report also found that on average, consumers shop at 5.4 different formats of grocery retailers (Gabbett, 2017). Despite these alternative shopping venues, studies consistently find that supermarkets (Broda et al., 2009;Alkon et al., 2013;Cannuscio et al., 2013;Ma et al., 2017;Ver Ploeg et al., 2017) or superstores (Taylor and Villas-Boas, 2016;Ver Ploeg et al., 2017) remain the top choice for food shopping, regardless of household income level, with the latter gaining market share (Stern et al., 2015). Studies reveal a variety of food shopping patterns with moderate variations across different income groups. A small study conducted in Philadelphia found that LI African American women spent a larger percentage of their food budget at limited assortment stores (e.g., Sav-A-Lot, Aldi's) (Chrisinger et al., 2018). Using 2005 Nielsen Homescan data, Broda et al. (2009) found that LI and middle-income households are more likely to shop at supercenters than high-income households, and high-income households are more likely to shop at club stores than LI and middle-income households. A more recent report from Ver Ploeg et al. (2017), however, found that supercenters are increasingly popular among all income groups with 44% of households using them for primary shopping compared to 45% using supermarkets. SNAP and food insecure households report similar shopping patterns as other households (Ver Ploeg et al., 2015). Rahkovsky and Snyder (2015) also found similar shopping patterns for low-income/low-access (LILA) and non-LILA households. This finding is not surprising given that nearly 40% of LI people in the USA live in neighborhoods that are not highpoverty neighborhoods (Wilde et al., 2014). Using Homescan and CES datasets, Damon et al. (2013) did find that SNAP households varied their food shopping locations once SNAP benefits were depleted; then relied on convenience and drug stores. Few studies report rural residents' shopping patterns. Using the national dataset FoodAPS, which tracks weekly shopping, Todd and Scharadin (2016) found insignificant differences in shopping locations and frequency between urban and rural households. A recent case study of five rural grocery stores found that residents spend nearly half of their food dollars at their locally owned store (Peterson and Proctor, 2018). Rural areas experience a scarcity of all food store types, with stores that carry the least healthful options the most prolific. Chain supermarkets are far more likely to be located in urban than rural areas, affecting affordability and availability (Liese et al., 2007;Powell et al., 2007;Bustillos et al., 2009;Dean and Sharkey, 2011;Campbell et al., 2017).\"\n",

      "        \"text\": \"Many factors, including income, participation in federal assistance programs, education, children in the household, rural/ urban status and race/ethnicity, are related to what foods people buy. Since purchasing is a reasonable metric of what people consume (Appelhans et al., 2017), determining food purchases provides a proxy for food consumption. In our intercept survey, we used SNAP as a proxy for income level. Andreyeva's et al. (2015) review of 25 studies on the dietary quality of SNAP participants found that they had a lower quality of diet than both income eligible and higher income participants, although caloric and nutrient intake were comparable. Similar to findings from FoodAPS, a national dataset on weekly shopping, Mancino et al. (2018) found that the nutritional quality of supermarket purchases was lower for SNAP recipients than other shoppers. Looking at the relationship of household income and food purchasing, Rahkovsky and Snyder (2015) found that over 1 year, households located in LILA areas purchased more foods overall, and specifically purchased more red meats, poultry, fish and sodas, and less fruits, vegetables and low-fat milk than non-LILA households. Two reports published by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER)- Handbury et al. (2015) and Allcott et al. (2017)-provide important insights into food purchasing in LI areas. The first is that the entry of new supermarkets into an area does not change consumer choices. Secondly, combining several secondary datasets to create composite variables, including the IRI dataset, Handbury et al. (2015) concluded that levels of education account for more of the variation in the quality of household food purchases than income. More educated shoppers purchased healthier foods more often than those less educated\"\n",

Using a structural demand model to understand the relationship between income and demand for healthy foods, Allcott et al. (2017) found that education accounts for approximately 21%, nutritional knowledge accounts for 7%, and differences in access to healthy foods account for about 5% of dietary differences. A recent study in two LI neighborhoods in Pittsburgh (Vaughan et al., 2017) corroborated some of these findings, reporting that educational achievement and being a SNAP recipient predicted food choices much better than where people shop. Research on the effect of children in the household and food purchasing is mixed. Using secondary data, Rahkovsky and Snyder (2015) looked at LI households with children under the age of 7 and found that they purchased 23% more fruit, 14% more low-fat red meats and 30% more low-fat milk products than households without children. In a study of 550 parentchild dyads with 40% of them classified as LI, researchers found that households with children that perceived cost as a barrier to purchasing produce did not have significantly different fruit and vegetable consumption patterns, by household income level; at the same time, households that spent the least amount on produce weekly also reported fewer daily servings of produce (Mushi-Brunt et al., 2007). Living in a rural area may also affect one's diet quality. Rahkovsky and Snyder (2015) learned that rural residents purchase larger amounts of red meat, less low-fat dairy and less produce than urban residents. Using primary data, another study found a small but statistically significant difference between urban and rural residents' fruit and vegetable consumption, with rural residents consuming less (Dean and Sharkey, 2011). Race and ethnicity are other factors to consider. Nielson's (2017) report on food retail and multicultural households noted that multicultural households (defined as Black, American Indian, Asian, Pacific Islander, other and two or more races and Hispanics of any race) spent a greater portion of their total food budget on fresh food categories, especially produce, seafood and meat. These patterns can be further disaggregated with Hispanic consumers spending more on fresh produce, packaged meat and juices; and Asian Americans spending more on seafood, followed by African Americans and Hispanics (Nielson, 2017). African American consumers bought poultry more frequently than any other group (Nielson, 2017). Some of the Nielsen findings are corroborated in published research on households and race. Zhen et al. (2009) observed that African Americans, Hispanics and Asians spent more on fish and seafood than whites. Rahkovsky and Snyder (2015) also found LILA African Americans purchased 60% more fish and poultry than white and Asian consumers as well as 31% more red meat. A small study in Houston found that African Americans allocated a greater proportion of their food budget to meat, fish, poultry and eggs than whites (Cullen et al., 2007). Another study conducted in Minnesota found that urban, LI African American women buy more meats like poultry and fish compared with other racial/ethnic groups, who spent more on beef and pork (Dammann and Smith, 2010). In the produce category, Hispanics (Nielson, 2017) and Asians spend more on fresh produce than whites and African Americans (Cullen et al., 2007;Zhen et al., 2009); African Americans purchase 11% more fruit than whites and Asian consumers (Rahkovsky and Snyder, 2015), while another study found no differences in produce purchases among racial groups (Dammann and Smith, 2010). It should be noted that none of these studies accounts for frozen produce sales. The findings summarized above indicate that different geographic contexts, racial categories, data sources and methodologies will lead to different results. Aside from the superstore finding, the analysis that follows corroborates much of what is known about shopping patterns and provides additional insights into differences in purchasing patterns particularly for race/ethnicity, and their relationship to income, education and other variables.\"\n",

      "        \"text\": \"Data collection took place at 13 'study stores' in nine project locations across the region from November 2012 to April 2015. The two eligibility criteria were that the store met the Food Marketing Institute (FMI) definition of a supermarket (a store that sells groceries, meat and produce and has at least $2 million in annual sales) and that it stocked all the MBIs. The MBIs consisted of whole and low-fat milk, white and whole wheat bread, regular and lean ground beef, fresh apples, cabbage, potatoes, frozen broccoli with and without sauce, and canned peaches in syrup and in juice. We selected a small number of MBIs because the foods formed the core of what was studied by all three research teams, including production and distribution. As illustrated in Clancy et al. (2017), we chose the specific items for many reasons, including that they would be staple foods for many LI households in the NE. The study stores were located in urban and rural locations, in zip codes where the median household income was near or below the median income for the state and county. About half of the stores were in zip codes with poverty rates above 20% and all were in counties with participation in SNAP greater than 10%. In all our study locations, the average food insecurity rate was approximately 13% (or higher), slightly above the regional average in 2013 of 12% (Coleman-Jensen et al., 2017). Summary statistics for the demographic characteristics of the surrounding areas of the 13 study stores are reported in Table 2. Project staff used intercept surveys to collect data from customers exiting the study store (n = 1996). Those interviewed were required to be 18 years or older and the primary food shopper in their household. Data collection took place across 9 of the 12 months, in mornings, afternoons and evenings. We included questions about respondents' demographic and household characteristics, including if they participated in any federal nutrition programs such as SNAP, WIC, school breakfast and lunch, where they shopped, and whether they had purchased any of the eight MBIs over the past 30 days. The survey also asked about the store choices of the respondents. The stores that respondents identified as the primary (where they do most shopping) or secondary stores (up to two other stores) were then categorized following the classification from the FMI's (Food Marketing Institute, 2015) food retail segment and Hawkes (2008) (see Fig. 1 and the Appendix). T-tests for differences in means Renewable Agriculture and Food Systems allowing for unequal variance of unpaired data were performed on several categories of questions. All analyses were conducted using STATA V. 14. Secondary data: data sources, data manipulation and analysis IRI Consumer Network Panel data The IRI CNP collects information on food purchases and demographic characteristics for a sample of more than 100,000 households across the USA (see Muth et al., 2016, for a discussion of the methodology and the data). The USDA ERS provided the data via a third-party access agreement. The dataset contained food-at-home purchases for multiple years. Sampling weights were available to produce a nationally representative sample, as well as US Census regions for a subsample of the data, the 'static panel'. The sample was restricted to 12,770 households in the EFNSE NE. Purchases for the year 2012 were aggregated at the annual level, the first year demographic data were available. National population sample weights were used instead of the NE ones, as these are created based on the US Census NE definition, which differs slightly from the EFSNE NE. Data manipulation: Household demographic attributes available in the IRI data include income, size, race/ethnicity and education of the household head, county of residence and the number of children (by age group). All purchase information in the CNP refers to the entire household because the primary shopper is not identified in the dataset. Household income and size were used to segment the sample into two groups based on whether the household was at or below 200% of the US Census Bureau Poverty Threshold (U.S. Census Bureau, 2012); households at or below this threshold were defined as LI whereas those above were NLI. This definition follows that used by the ERS-USDA in their Food Access Research Atlas. Participants' county of residence was linked with the USDA (2013) Rural-Urban Continuum Codes (RUCCs) (United States Department of Agriculture, 2013) to determine if the household was located in an urban or rural area. Participants residing in counties in metro areas (RUCCs 1-3) were categorized as urban while all others (RUCCs 4-9) were categorized as rural. Data analysis: The CNP dataset includes information on the different types of stores where the purchases took place, namely grocery stores (similar to supermarkets in the intercept survey and CES dataset), superstores, club stores, mass merchandisers, drug stores, dollar stores, convenience stores and 'all others.' An illustration of the different store-types included in the CNP data can be found in Volpe et al. (2017). Weight-adjusted differences in means using national sampling weights were calculated to assess how food expenditure shares, and the number of purchase occasions at the different types of stores varied for LI and NLI households and urban and rural households. It should be noted that these values do not include purchases as the product sold as 'random weight' items (e.g., bread from the bakery department) and only represent packaged products, including produce items. Additionally, the CNP data were used to analyze purchasing patterns, as described in Cleary et al. (2017) and Clancy et al. (2017). In this paper, we summarize some of the MBI purchase results illustrated in those two papers, as well as an original analysis of the differences between purchasers and non-purchasers of selected MBIs. All the analyses performed with the CNP data are weight-adjusted tests for differences in means using the sampling weights and were performed using STATA v.14. The CES is a survey that collects data on US households and their purchases of multiple products including foods. The survey uses national and regional probability samples of US households representative of the civilian, non-institutionalized population (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2016a). Participating households are recruited through the mail and data collection is conducted through face-to-face interviews and paper surveys (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2016b). Primary respondents for the CES are considered to be the head of household (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2016a). The CES includes two unique survey components: the Household Characteristics Questionnaire and the Expenditures Diary. Data for this research were obtained by linking the two datasets through a common identifier for every quarter in 2012, 2013 and 2014. The final dataset included 3428 household observations for the NE. Data manipulation: The primary survey respondent reports socio-demographic characteristics for themselves and their household; those included in the analysis were chosen for their significance in the literature regarding associations with purchasing behaviors and their similarity to independent variables in the customer intercept survey data. The socio-demographic variables included in the analysis are: household income (LI or NLI), based on whether the household was at or below 200% of the US Census Bureau Poverty Threshold (coded as 0 for households with income above-and 1 for those below); children younger than 18 in the household; ethnicity of the primary respondent (non-Hispanic, Hispanic); race of the primary respondent (White, Black, Asian and Other); education of the primary respondent (less than a college education, college education and more than college); and household participation in SNAP in the last 12 months. Purchasing data on the 104 food items in the survey were combined into 12 categories and sub-categories from the USDA What We Eat in America methodology used in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey national food survey (USDA, 2016). The categories and sub-categories included milk and dairy, meats, poultry, seafood, eggs, cured meats, non-meat proteins, mixed dishes, grains, snacks and sweets, fruit and vegetables. The USDA categories and sub-categories were used as binary dependent variables, coded as a zero '0' if there were no purchases within that category over the two consecutive week sampling interval and '1' if there was a purchase within that category. Data analysis: To maintain consistency with the CNP analysis, \\u03c7 2 tests for independence were conducted to assess differences in food purchasing within the 12 food categories by income level. Renewable Agriculture and Food Systems 5 For the remaining variables, multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to estimate the associations between sociodemographic characteristics and purchasing of foods within the categories.\"\n",

Figure 1 includes the descriptive statistics for the analysis of declared primary and secondary food stores. Approximately 7% shopped at supercenters. Similar patterns were noted for secondary stores with grocery stores being the most frequented (78-60% traditional supermarkets and 17% limited-assortment stores), followed by supercenters (10%). Additionally, we analyzed whether differences in participants' declared primary store for food purchases differed according to their participation in federal nutrition programs (N = 1,117 participating; N = 859 non-participating) and urban-rural status (N = 1,595, urban; N = 402, rural); see values in Table 2. Almost 60% of respondents in federal nutrition programs identified a supermarket as their primary store, vs 69% of non-program participants (values statistically different from one another). A higher percentage of participants using federal nutrition programs, however, declared to shop at limited-assortment stores than those not using food assistance (30 and 18%, respectively). No statistical difference emerges for the percentage of primary shoppers using traditional supermarkets in rural and urban areas (65 and 64%, respectively). A larger percentage of urban participants used limited-assortment stores (26%) as their primary store than rural participants (15%). However, a higher share of rural participants than urban declare supercenters as their primary stores (18 vs 4%) ( Table 3). Secondary data: expenditure shares and shares of purchase occasions The analysis that follows focuses on the average share of expenditure and purchase occasions of households in the EFSNE NE as they appear in the CNP for the year 2012. As previously mentioned, these values do not include random weight purchases and only represent packaged products. The analysis discussed below will focus on the share of the number of trips (over total number of trips to all store types) and expenditure shares (over total food purchases at all store types) by store type. The values in Figure 2 show that, overall, the largest shares of both food expenditures and purchase occasions are recorded for grocery stores (67 and 57%, respectively). Supercenters comprise about 10% value of sales (8% of purchase occasions), followed by the aggregate 'all others' store types (amounting to 7% expenditures and 11% of purchase occasions). Differences in food expenditure shares at different store types by income and urban status are presented in Table 4. The data show small differences in the expenditure shares between LI and NLI households for all food stores except 'all others' and mass merchandisers. In particular, NLI have a higher share of food expenditures than LIs at both grocery stores and club stores, and a lower share at superstores, dollar stores and convenience stores. Urban households show higher food expenditure shares than rural ones for all store types except in the case of superstores (where rural household had 16% higher shares than urban ones) and dollar stores (2%). \\nThe values in Figures 1 and 2 show the importance of grocery stores (which include both traditional supermarkets and limited \"\n",

As reported by Clancy et al. (2017), intercept survey respondents showed a higher share of purchasing any of the MBIs (except cabbage) if they had children under the age of 5 in the household. IRI CNP: characteristics of purchasers and non-purchasers of MB items Using the 2012 CNP data, we analyzed purchasing patterns of MBIs in the NE across NLI and LI households and urban and rural households. Income: Compared to NLI households, a larger share of LI households were purchasers of all the MBIs, purchasing also larger quantities, most likely because NLI households purchase more food away from home (Saksena et al., 2018). A smaller share of LI households purchased skim/low-fat milk and lean ground beef compared to NLI, whereas a larger share purchased whole milk, non-lean ground beef and potatoes. The values illustrated below in Table 5 synthesize the analysis of the difference in means between groups of purchasers and nonpurchasers of the different MBIs as a function of demographic characteristics and LI and NLI status (N = 2481 for LI, and N = 10,289 for NLI). Children: Overall, LI and NLI households with younger children had a higher percentage of purchasers than non-purchasers for almost all the MBIs. For households with younger children, there were no differences in the percentages of purchasers and Renewable Agriculture and Food Systems non-purchasers of whole milk and lean ground beef.

Among both LI and NLI households with older children, we observed a higher share of purchasers of regular ground beef and white bread, compared to non-purchasers. We also found a higher share of purchasers of white bread among LI and NLI households with older children but not LI with younger children. Race and ethnicity: For whole milk, we found a larger share of purchasers than non-purchasers for both LI and NLI households with a black household head. A higher share of purchasers of lean ground beef was observed for both LI and NLI white households. We also found a higher share of purchasers of white bread among NLI black and Hispanic household heads. Income categories: Smaller percentages of households with incomes less than $14,990 were purchasers of many of the MBIs (with the exception of whole milk and regular ground beef), compared to purchasers. LI households with incomes between $35,000 and $59,999 have larger shares of purchasers of both skim milk and whole milk, regular ground beef, both white bread and wheat bread, peaches, broccoli and potatoes. We also find more purchasers than non-purchasers among NLI households in the same income bracket for whole milk, regular ground beef and white bread. Education: With regard to levels of education, both LI and NLI households headed by people with some high school, or high school graduates, show higher shares of purchasers (compared to non-purchasers) of whole milk, regular ground beef, white bread, potatoes and peaches. NLI households headed by a person with some college show more purchasers than non-purchasers when it comes to whole milk, both types of ground beef, both types of bread, peaches and potatoes. NLI households headed by a high school graduate also showed more purchasers than nonpurchasers when it comes to whole milk, regular ground beef, both types of bread, peaches, broccoli and potatoes.\\nIn this section, we review the findings of the analysis of the CNP and intercept survey data separately from those of the CES data to avoid confusion between specific foods and categories of foods. Where possible, we also compare these findings with the literature. As noted in Table 1, income is defined by federal nutrition program participation for the intercept survey, and by above and below 200% of the poverty level for CNP and CES. Both the intercept results and the CNP analysis find a higher percentage of LI households to be purchasers of all the MBIs than NLI households, purchasing also larger quantities, most likely because NLI households purchase more food away from home (Saksena et al., 2018). Our findings align with Rahkovsky and Snyder's (2015) research that LI households purchase more foods to be consumed at home overall. Looking at specific market basket foods, the intercept survey data show a higher share of program participants being purchasers of all fruits and vegetables in the market basket than nonparticipants. In contrast, the results of the CES analysis show smaller shares of households using SNAP purchasing fruit, results. Also, comparable to Rahkovsky and Snyder's (2015) finding that LILA purchase less fruit, and to Leung et al. (2012) who report that SNAP participants consume fewer fruits and vegetables. The intercept findings may reflect the popularity of produce items in the MB compared to the broad category of fruit used in CES. Both LI and NLI households show a higher incidence of purchasers of skim milk than non-purchasers; in contrast, Rahkovsky and Snyder (2015) report that LILA households are more likely to purchase low-fat milk than non-LILA. Our finding may reflect a trend away from whole milk purchasing, except for African American households. The intercept findings on bread purchasing patterns are similar to those obtained with the IRI CNP data, a higher share of LI households are purchasers of wheat and white bread. The intercept found that program participant respondents are equally likely to purchase whole wheat bread as non-program participants. Because wheat bread is significantly more expensive than white bread, LI households (or program participants) may place a high value on the nutritional differences between wheat and white bread. Those households participating in the WIC program are urged to purchase wheat bread, which could account for part of the difference (Andreyeva et al., 2011). The analysis of the IRI CNP data found that LI and NLI households are equally likely to purchase ground beef, although smaller percentages of LI households purchase lean ground beef, which likely is a function of lean ground beef's higher price or taste preferences. Smaller percentages of LI households in the CES purchase foods in nine of the 12 food categories than those above the poverty threshold, in contrast to the findings obtained from IRI CNP and intercept survey data that a higher share of LI households are purchasers of all MBIs, which may be due to the fact that we consider food categories in the CES and individual foods in the CNP and the intercept survey. In summary, the IRI CNP and the intercept results find that LI households purchased more MBIs and show similar purchasing patterns for low-fat milk and wheat bread as non-LI households. While there is no difference in the share of purchasers and nonpurchasers of ground beef among LI households, a smaller share purchases lean ground beef. The CES analysis finds a smaller share of LI purchasing milk and dairy, meats, eggs, cured meats, non-meat proteins, fruit, vegetables, snacks and sweets and mixed dishes. Heterogeneity of patterns may reflect differences in taste and cultural preferences and health-seeking behaviors. Education: Similar to the findings from Handbury et al. (2015), we find that a smaller share of respondents with higher levels of education of the household head (college graduate and holding a post-graduate degree) are purchasers of some of the 'less healthy' MBI (whole milk, regular beef, white bread); a result that holds only for white bread in LI households. Children in household: Both the analyses of the IRI CNP and intercept survey data show that having young children in the household is associated with purchasing the majority of the MBIs. Similarly, the analysis of the CES finds that having children in the households is associated with purchasing across all food categories. LI and NLI households with young children show more purchasers than non-purchasers for almost all the MBIs, including skim milk, lean ground beef, wheat bread, frozen broccoli and potatoes. A likely reason for this result is that households with children may prepare more meals at home while seeking to meet dietary needs for children's growth. This finding may also reflect participation in the WIC program. Rural: We find no significant differences between urban and rural households with regards to purchasing the MBIs, while Rahkovsky and Snyder (2015) find that LILA urban households purchases are similar to non-LILA rural households. Race and ethnicity: Most of our findings related to race and ethnicity support previous literature, although most of the literature focuses on proteins and produce. In the protein category, we found a larger share of Hispanics purchasing seafood and poultry, and a larger share of Asians purchasing seafood. Zhen et al. (2009) also found that Hispanics, Asians, as well as African Americans spend more on fish and seafood than whites. The CES analysis finds that a larger share of African Americans are purchasers of poultry, similar to Nielson (2017), Zhen et al. (2009) and Rahkovsky and Snyder (2015). In the produce category, we found a higher percentage of Hispanics being purchasers of fruit, similar to Nielson's (2017) findings. Other studies have found that Asians also spend more Renewable Agriculture and Food Systems on fresh produce than whites and African Americans (Zhen et al., 2009;Cullen et al., 2007). The CES analysis found that a smaller share of African Americans purchased fruits and vegetables, in contrast to Rahkovsky and Snyder (2015) who report that African Americans spent 11% more on fruit. Studies conducted on ethnic populations have found that the major barriers among LI populations to the purchase and consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables are the high cost and high spoilage rates, a perceived lack of time and the extensive preparation time for cooking vegetables (Yeh et al., 2008;Stephens et al., 2015). Further, the analysis of the CES and IRI CNP both find distinct purchasing differences across ethnic groups for dairy categories, with a larger share of African Americans being non-purchasers of milk and dairy. Rahkovsky and Snyder (2015) also found that African Americans are less likely to purchase dairy products, possibly due to higher rates of lactose intolerance.\"\n",

There are no differences in purchasing between LI and NLI households for poultry, seafood and grains. We also assessed associations between socio-demographic characteristics and food purchasing, which are presented in Table 7. Having children in the household (31% of the sample) is positively associated with purchasing across all food categories; the most significant differences appeared in grains and milk and dairy. The CES data show that households using SNAP (10% of the sample) show a smaller share of fruit purchasers, compared to non-purchasers. Ethnicity and race are associated with different purchasing patterns, particularly in the protein and dairy categories. A higher percentage of Hispanics, compared to non-Hispanics purchased poultry, seafood, meats, eggs non-meat proteins and fruit. Smaller percentages of African Americans and Asian respondents instead purchased milk and dairy, cured meats, and fruits and vegetables.

Both in terms of being the primary or secondary store, and in terms of expenditure and purchase occasion shares, supercenters and other formats are of secondary importance. These findings are similar to previous research which show, regardless of income, that most households utilize traditional supermarkets for their food shopping; the results of food expenditure shares using the CNP data follow the same pattern. Unlike previous studies (Broda et al., 2009;Taylor and Villas-Boas, 2016;Ver Ploeg et al., 2017), our results overall show supercenters as a distant second to supermarkets in terms of store preference, expenditures and purchase occasions. From the intercept data analysis, we find that a larger shares of respondents participating in federal nutrition programs shop at limited-assortment supermarkets, compared to nonparticipants, with 30% of them identifying limited-assortment stores as their primary store, similar to the Chrisinger et al. (2018) findings that lower income households spend a larger percentage of their budget at limited assortment stores. The intercept findings may reflect the characteristics and locations of our sample of shoppers. Most limited assortment stores meet the classification of a supermarket used in other datasets and offer competitive prices, which may account for their popularity among LI households. Differences in food expenditure shares at different store types by income and urban status are presented in Table 4. The data show small differences in the expenditure shares between LI and NLI households for all food stores except 'all others' and mass merchandisers. In particular, NLI households have a higher share of food expenditures than LI households at both grocery stores and club stores, and a lower share at superstores, dollar stores and convenience stores. Similar to Broda et al. (2009), we find small differences in food expenditures between LI and NLI purchasing at convenience stores (1.5 vs 0.7%).   \"\n",

While convenience and dollar stores are increasing their presence in rural areas (Bustillos et al., 2009;Campbell et al., 2017), when compared to urban households, both the intercept and IRI CNP data analysis find that a larger share of rural households use supercenters/superstores and show higher food expenditures at these store types than urban households. Like urban households, supermarkets are the declared primary store and also rank highest in expenditures. This finding is corroborated in a recent case study of five rural grocers that found residents spend nearly half of their food dollars at their locally-owned grocery/supermarket (Peterson and Proctor, 2018). Supermarkets may be located in an LI, middle-or high-income neighborhood but attract shoppers from different income categories or be located in an LI neighborhood and attract middle-and high-income shoppers. Rahkovsky and Snyder (2015) discuss census findings from 2010 that estimate 32% of urban and 42% of rural residents live in LI areas but are not poor themselves. This is similar to Wilde's et al. (2014) finding that 40% of LI people live in neighborhoods that are not high poverty, making placebased interventions an imperfect solution to food access problems.\"\n",

      "        \"text\": \"The key variables in this study are measured in a variety of ways, which makes comparing across the datasets challenging and may account for some of the differences in our findings. For example, the definition of, and the language describing store categories vary with small but significant differences as to what constitutes a supermarket, grocery store, small grocery, etc. The definition of the stores used in the IRI data analysis does not uniquely match that of the FMI. With current retail trends, it would be helpful for future analyses to use a standard classification to ensure comparability. For example, the FMI's categorization is the one most cited and is used for this paper with a modification. Measurements for store preferences also vary. The IRI dataset uses expenditures and purchase occasions as the metric for store preferences, while the intercept survey uses self-reported store preferences. The issue of purchasing variables arises in many studies. The CES utilizes aggregated food groups and the IRI and the intercept survey utilize a limited number of food items. Also, the IRI does not measure non-packaged produce items, which means the analysis is missing non-packaged produce purchases and produce purchased outside of the MBIs. As noted in Table 1, the choice of demographic questions also varies across datasets. For example, the intercept survey asks about children in the household under the age of 5 while the other two datasets ask about children under the age of 18. Income and poverty measures also vary across datasets, which may account for some variation in our results and comparability. In our intercept survey analysis, we used participation in any federal nutrition program as a proxy for income, while for the analysis of the IRI CNP and CEE data, we used the 200% or less of the federal poverty line. This means we have not captured the gap between 200% of the poverty line and the cutoffs for SNAP, WIC and school lunch eligibility.\"\n",

      "        \"text\": \"Our analysis used three datasets to describe trends in store choice and food purchasing among LI households in the NE USA. One strength of this study is the ability to examine a number of variables that have shown to be correlated with shopping and purchasing decisions and compare the findings with trends and analyses that have been reported in other studies. Some of the differences we found may be a reflection of the characteristics of shoppers in the NE region. We may also be witnessing changes in shopping and purchasing trends that are taking place over time. Using a multi-faceted approach to understand the suite of factors related to the food purchasing of LI households challenges researchers to consider the complexity of the issue. We offer two notable findings on store choices about limited assortment supermarkets and supercenters. The analysis of the intercept survey shows that one in four urban residents use limited assortment stores as their primary store, and that a larger share of program participants shop at limited assortment stores compared to non-participants. The appeal of this store format for LI or urban individuals warrants further research to understand how these smaller format supermarkets can fulfill nutritional needs without the level of investment (and profits) required to support superstores or supermarkets. Also, supercenters appeal to rural residents more than urban; however, the CNP data suggest that supercenters comprised only 10% of sales and 8% of purchase occasions of food-at-home. While nationwide trends continue to show superstores with increased market share, we did not find that trend from the IRI or the intercept data for the NE. Our review of the literature also indicates that there is a paucity of research on rural households' food purchasing habits: a gap that should be filled with more studies and tested for replicability. It is also possible that other studies have not found significant differences between urban and rural households, thus are not reporting a null finding. Understanding these gaps would help inform interventions and policymaking in the rural arena. We find a few studies that look at purchasing patterns and children in the household. Based on our findings, the presence of children is correlated with healthier food purchasing in the household, similar to Rahkovsky and Snyder (2015) (see page 6). Additional research on the role of children in shifting purchase patterns would help define opportunities for intervention. Another finding worth emphasizing is that while differences in purchasing patterns across household income levels may be statistically significant, they are small, and are likely not of public health significance. Except for whole milk and lean ground beef, our intercept survey data reveal similar purchases across program participants and non-participants. The analysis of IRI data finds a smaller share of LI households to be purchasers of low-fat milk and lean ground beef than NLI households, while the CES data showed racial and ethnic differences, regardless of income. At this point, it may not be as important to study these types of differences as it is to acknowledge that several recent studies point out that demand for healthy foods is a much greater driver of purchases than supply is. Research that focuses on why these differences exist may be more useful to programs and interventions and even policies than more information about what the differences are, as we illustrated earlier with regard to LI ethnic food choices. For those seeking to increase healthier purchasing for specific audiences, some of these findings on specific foods may be useful. For example, because wheat bread is purchased by all income groups, researchers could investigate what has motivated households to change from white to wheat bread (Chase et al., 2003). Racial and ethnic preferences for protein foods may guide program implementers to suggest culturally appropriate products with healthier preparation methods. While households at all income levels fail to meet dietary guidelines, LI households encounter additional challenges with lower levels of education, and less access to transportation, and purchasing decisions may reflect those challenges. Thus, it will be important for policymakers, practitioners and researchers to examine more deeply the context and the complexities of food purchasing choices of LI households that go beyond quantitative analyses.\"\n",
